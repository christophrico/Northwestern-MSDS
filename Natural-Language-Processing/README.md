## About The Course
Comprehensive review of text analytics and natural language processing with a focus on recent developments in computational linguistics and machine learning. Using unstructured and semi-structured text from online sources, document collections, and databases parse text into numeric vectors and to convert higher dimensional vectors into lower dimensional vectors for subsequent analysis and modeling.
