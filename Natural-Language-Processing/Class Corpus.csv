0,Martian_1.docx,"Left for dead on the red planet following a scientifically anomalous but narratively necessary windstorm, botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon, giving Cast Away-era Tom Hanks a run for his money) must hunker down for the long haul, knowing that any rescue mission is years away. Luckily, he is quite literally “the best botanist on the planet”, and after declaring that he’ll have to “science the shit” out of his Robinson Crusoe situation, he discovers that it is indeed possible to grow potatoes in his own poo.

This is just the first of many self-help survivalist discoveries that find Watney entertainingly facing up to the challenge of “not dying”. Armed only with recordings of Happy Days and his captain’s collection of old-school floor-fillers (like Guardians of the Galaxy, The Martian takes great delight in its anachronistic retro-pop stylings), our lonely starman pitches his skills against the inhospitable elements, counting the solar days (“sols”) until help arrives even as mission control fight their own battles, practical and geopolitical. 

Lifting underlying riffs from Doug Trumbull’s Silent Running and third-act visuals from Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity, with coincidental hints of Interstellar (Damon is once again stranded on a distant planet, a world away from Jessica Chastain – what are the chances?), The Martian delivers on both intergalactic spectacle and feet-in-the-soil character drama. Like Duncan Jones’s Moon, much of the film’s running time finds its leading man basically talking to himself, with video diaries and delayed digital communications providing a handy dramatic framework for his quip-filled soliloquies. Damon makes the most of this “me time”, engaging our interest, winning our sympathy and teasing our anxieties about his perilous predicament. Meanwhile, his former crewmates wrestle with the guilt of his unexpected survival (Jessica Chastain does a very practical line in understated angst and heroic mutiny), while on Earth, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig et al argue the whys and wherefores of bringing him home.

Crisply shot by Ridley regular Dariusz Wolski, who also photographed this week’s other eye-catching release, The Walk, The Martian keeps its visual palette positive, the ochre sands of Jordan’s Wadi Rum blending with vast Budapest soundstage interiors to provide a glowing backdrop for the space-suited action. With its seductive blend of hi-tech Nasa chic and Apollo 13-style DIY, the production design creates a lived-in feel that echoes the industrial environments of Alien. For all its technical liberties, the pop science convinces just enough to be both credible and intriguing – younger viewers in particular will be sent away with renewed (if slightly skewed) interests in chemistry, biology and astronomy, the latter further boosted by last week’s real-life Martian news stories, providing the kind of publicity of which PR androids can only dream.

Most important, however, is just how much fun Scott seems to be having with The Martian. While Prometheus was all but crushed by the lumbering weight of its self-consciously portentous dialogue (much ear-scraping exposition about God and interstellar “engineers”), this revels in the down-to-earth details of making a meal out of a potato when you’ve run out of ketchup, and the sheer absurdist pleasure of watching human beings outwit the universe with Sellotape and string. Whether forthcoming projects such as Alien: Paradise Lost or the proposed Blade Runner sequel will be half as entertaining remains to be seen, but for now let’s just be thankful that there is plenty of life on Mars."

“Endings are hard, especially for me,” director J.J. Abrams recently said when discussing Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. That’s understandable. His new film is intended to serve as a conclusion to both Disney’s Star Wars sequel trilogy and the entire Skywalker saga that first began with George Lucas all the way back in 1977. Landing that speeder is akin to successfully firing on a thermal exhaust port just two-meters wide—it’s a one-in-a-million shot that requires an assist from the Force.

Star Wars is the most intensely scrutinized blockbuster franchise in the world, and both its supporters and its critics are really good at yelling. Ending it in a universally satisfying conclusion simply isn’t possible and The Rise of Skywalker reflects that reality. That raises the central question that has come to define this new era of Star Wars: What the hell do fans want?

They want the new Star Wars trilogy to capture the magic of the original series while simultaneously standing on its own as new and unique creations. They want to be emotionally invested in the characters, but only if they adhere to a strict guideline of development. They don’t want their Star Wars movies filled with politics, even though A New Hope was a fantastical response to the Vietnam War. They want these films to make them feel like they did when they were children while still appealing to adults. The checklist of expectations and desires is simply a collection of oppositional mandates. If we hyper-analyze these movies, we’ll always find something they can do better. If we allow them to exist as they are with the acceptance of imperfection, they will be easier to enjoy. Neither is a particularly simple ask.

Some choices made by Abrams and screenwriter Chris Terrio feel like unnecessary course corrections from Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, which drew the ire of a small but vocal contingent of viewers despite being the highest grossing film of 2017. The duality was striking; a critically praised global blockbuster that nonetheless proved so polarizing that we’re still arguing about its merits and missteps two years later.

The Last Jedi has it flaws—as all Star Wars movies do—but Johnson’s bold ambition to deconstruct the Jedi mythos and subvert our expectations while side-stepping fan theories is not one of them. By acknowledging that the Jedi Order was plagued by “hypocrisy, hubris,” Johnson’s film theoretically freed the franchise to move into new territory that didn’t rely on hero worship and institutions that the 40-year-old franchise had grown beyond. Abrams has instead instituted a “return to normalcy” that recalibrates the finale’s focus on familiar yet effective construction rather than challenging its audience. In other words, it’s Lucasfilm’s attempt to provide what the studio believes audiences are clamoring for.



The emotional highs of The Rise of Skywalker are undoubtedly fantastic as it attempts to convey that you can choose your own destiny and that there are things more powerful than blood. It is often a swashbuckling adventure film that sparks the kid inside of you as it delivers a series of big movie moments ripe for broad appeal. The dynamic between Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren/Ben Solo (Adam Driver) is the foundational support beam of the film, and the sequel trilogy as a whole, as it delivers the emotional stakes fans want. Both characters straddle the line between light and dark and represent both the best and the worst of the Force while exhibiting how the two can be interchangeable at times. Through them, we understand how easily power, whether wielded with noble intentions or not, can yield unintended consequences that alter who you are."
2,Blank_Check_1.docx,"Blank Check

“Blank Check” is a low-yield Disney programmer that may generate some interest among pre-teen and young adolescent auds. Theatrical B.O. likely will amount to small change, but pic may do better when deposited in video outlets.

With more than a wink and a nod in the direction of the “Home Alone” blockbusters — and a preemptive hint of the forthcoming “Richie Rich”– director Rupert Wainwright and writers Blake Snyder and Colby Carr bend over backward to contrive a fantasy-fulfillment scenario for pic’s target audience.

Eleven-year-old Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall) feels badly put-upon by his penny-pinching, aphorism-spouting father (James Rebhorn) and pushed around by his bullying older siblings (Michael Faustino, Chris Demetral). The final straw comes when Preston is invited to a classmate’s amusement-park birthday party, but lacks enough money to join other guests on the A-ticket rides. After that, Preston wishes aloud that he had his own money.

Quicker than you can say “I made my parents disappear!” Preston runs into fugitive criminal Quigley (Miguel Ferrer). Or, to be more precise, Quigley runs into Preston’s bike, with his car. Anxious not to arouse police interest, he gives the boy a half-completed check to pay for the damage, then drives off.

Preston fills in the amount of the check –$ 1 million, the exact sum Quigley has deposited in the money-laundering bank operated by a former cohort (Michael Lerner) — and cashes it.

Palming himself off as the young aide of a fictitious “Mr. Macintosh,” Preston buys a palatial home in his neighborhood, then stocks it with high-tech games.

Tyro director Wainwright made his mark as an award-winning maker of commercial spots, and his experience serves him well here: Seldom has conspicuous consumption been made to seem so exhilarating.

“Blank Check” wallows in the exuberance of excess so enthusiastically, for so long, that even naive youngsters may have trouble buying pic’s ultimate “money can’t buy happiness” message.

It takes more than an hour to get to the real pay-off — Preston’s “Home Alone”-style defense of his home against a siege by Quigley and his cohorts. Unfortunately, the sequenceis too short to live up to its build-up, and not ingenious enough.

Bonsall is believable without being particularly memorable. Rick Ducommun offers an adequate John Candy impersonation as the chauffeur hired by the young millionaire.

Ferrer, savvy enough to play it straight, makes a wonderfully menacing foil. Debbie Allen overdoes flustery hysterics as a caterer.

Although plot is set in small-town Indiana, pic was shot in central Texas. Tech credits are unremarkable."
3,Back_Future_3.docx,"If “Back to the Future” made you bored and querulous, then the tumbling inventiveness in its sequel may come as a pleasant surprise. Of course, if you were among the 92% of the world who loved the ride in Dr. Emmett Brown’s diabolical DeLorean back in 1985, then “Back to the Future Part II” (citywide) is your oyster. Well, your hamburger with onions.

If it proves anything, it’s that director Robert Zemeckis (“Who Framed Roger Rabbit”) is getting cooler and even more adept at controlled mayhem. Actually, “Future II’s” best moments are like a Tex Avery cartoon with live actors, crammed to the edges of the frame with nutsy touches.

This is not to say that it isn’t one of the year’s noisiest films, nor one of the most dizzying. It not only zooms up to the year 2015, but back again to that fateful high school dance of Marty McFly’s parents in 1955, then up for a while to 1985. And not 1985 as the characters knew it, but a sort of faux 1985, the Ghost of 1985-yet-to-come-in-the-worst-of-all-possible-worlds.

Now, you may whiz up and back and sideways with the ease of Isaac Asimov, but not this time traveler. So it is invigorating to report that screenwriter Bob Gale has had pity on the spaced-out. When he begins his backs and forths in the Chrono-Synclastic Infundibulum or whatever, he has the eminent Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) diagram it all out on a blackboard for us. Thus, even the dimmest among us can appreciate exactly why McFly and Doc must risk time-warp whiplash to keep their universe, and perhaps even ours, on an even keel.

It all begins with danger in the year 2015 to Marty McFly’s son, Marty Jr. (conveniently played by McFly “himself,” Michael J. Fox, surely one of the world’s oldest high school students and one of the more bearable). Scanning the future, Doc Brown knows there is big trouble if Marty Jr. goes along with the scuzzy plans of a guy named Griff, so McFly and Brown nip up to 2015 in the gull-winged DeLorean to see if they can change history, or future history. With them is McFly’s girlfriend, Jennifer, played by the talented and, in this instance, vastly wasted Elizabeth Shue. Also wasted are the talents of “Breaking In’s” Casey Siemaszko, almost unfindable here as a third thug.

“Future""-ites will already be onto the fact that Griff is the son of Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson, both times), who made the life of the McFly family father, George, such a living hell. Frankly, the braying of Crispin Glover’s George McFly in the first film made some of our lives living hell too, so it came as good news that Glover appears in the sequel only in brief silent scenes taken from footage in the first film. The grandfather George McFly is played in the year 2015 by Jeffrey Weissman.

When film makers’ visions of the future spin off nearly familiar technology, the results are more fun than brainstorming wild inventions that take forever to understand."
4,Walle_1.docx,"… Hazy, dust-filtered sunlight illuminates a landscape of eerie, post-apocalyptic silence. This is a world without people, you might say without animation, though it teems with evidence of past life.

 “Wall-E” is a computer-generated cartoon vision of our own potential extinction. It’s not the only film lately to engage this somber theme. As the earth heats up, the vanishing of humanity has become something of a hot topic. Not that “Wall-E” is all gloom and doom. It is, undoubtedly, an earnest (though far from simplistic) ecological parable, but it is also a disarmingly sweet and simple love story. 

Wall-E is a dented little workhorse who, having outlasted his planned obsolescence, spends his days in the Sisyphean, mechanical labor of gathering and compacting garbage. His name is an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter- Earth Class. But not everything he finds is trash to Wall-E. In the rusty metal hulk where he and the cockroach take shelter from dust storms, he keeps a carefully sorted collection of treasures, including Zippo lighters, nuts and bolts, and a Rubik’s Cube.

Wall-E’s tender regard for the material artifacts of a lost civilization is understandable. After all, he too is a product of human ingenuity. And the genius of “Wall-E” lies in its notion that creativity and self-destruction are sides of the same coin. The human species was driven off its home planet Wall-E eventually learns that we did not die out by an economy consecrated to the manufacture and consumption of ever more stuff. But some of that stuff turned out to be useful, interesting, and precious. And some of it may even possess something like a soul.

Observing Wall-E’s surroundings conglomerate filled the earth with megastores and tons of garbage. Eventually the corporation loaded its valued customers onto a space station, where they have evolved into fat, lazy leisure addicts serviced by a new generation of specialized machines. One of these, a research probe named Eve drops to Earth and wins Wall-E’s heart.

Wall-E is a boxy machine of the old school, with creaks and clanks and visible rivets, his surface pocked with dents and patches of rust. He is steadfast, but not always clever or cool. Eve, shaped like an elongated egg, is as cool as the next iPhone and whisper quiet, unless she’s excited, in which case she has a tendency to blow things up. She and Wall-E communicate in chirps and beeps that occasionally coalesce into words. Somehow their expressions of desire, irritation, indifference, devotion and anxiety, all arranged in delicate counterpoint achieve an otherworldly eloquence.

The residents of the space station, accustomed to being tended by industrious robots, have grown to resemble giant babies, with soft faces, rounded torsos and stubby, weak limbs. Consumer capitalism, anticipating every possible need and swaddling its subjects in convenience, is an infantilizing force. But as they cruise around on reclining chairs, eyes fixed on video screens, taking in calories from straws sticking out of giant cups, these overgrown space babies also look like moviegoers at a multiplex."
5,Toy_Story_1.docx,"It was only a matter of time before the Toy Story franchise started asking questions about the very nature of consciousness. 



Toy Story 4 wisely feels like less of a new chapter and more like an epilogue, an addendum for Woody that muses on the peculiarities of the symbiotic relationship between toys and humans these movies have long explored. But the film’s most challenging, bizarre, and lovable material involves a beady-eyed Frankenstein’s monster named Forky (Tony Hale) who becomes the newest addition to Bonnie’s flock after she builds him in kindergarten class. Most important, he doesn’t know why he’s alive, and reader, that’s when I leaned forward in my seat.



Sure, the fun can last forever for Woody, but that’s because he’s functionally immortal—as long as nothing ever rips his stuffing out, he can exist eternally, thanks to whatever toy magic is powering him. More than anything, the film is about him arriving at new insights about this immortality as he reflects on the creation of Forky, a plastic creature who can think and speak simply because his creator (a kindergartener) pasted him together in class.



That’s not to suggest that most of Toy Story 4 involves Woody and his pals sitting around their bedroom and debating the writings of Descartes. The plot is, as usual for these films, an extended action caper, set mostly at an amusement park that Bonnie’s family is visiting on vacation. But the adventure is spurred into motion by Forky jumping out of a car window because he knows that he’s a creature made of trash and thinks he deserves to die. At multiple points, Woody and Buzz discuss their own “inner voices” (their consciences) and how those drive them to make selfless decisions, like rescuing an existentially compromised living spork. Toy Story 4 can have all the fun it wants, and it does, but it also throws these deeper concepts around with abandon.



Woody’s mission to rescue Forky involves convincing the little fella that toyhood is a noble calling, and that the joy he brings Bonnie is enough reason to keep on living. That’s the essential concept that drove all the other Toy Story films—the powerful, nostalgic bond between a child and their most beloved possessions. But as Woody explores the amusement park and its environs, he rediscovers Bo Peep (Annie Potts), one of Andy’s old toys, who was given away years ago and was absent in Toy Story 3. She’s now leading an independent life free of her owner, along with a motley crew of new characters like the Canadian action figure Duke Caboom (a masterfully dry Keanu Reeves) and the wisecracking plush animals Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele).



Can toys live on their own? What separates a toy from an inanimate object? Can a toy choose its own kid to play with? Is Woody’s existence, in a happy home with a comfortable family, an unusually privileged one? And can toys themselves start to grow up, even become parents, as Woody does to Forky (in a manner of speaking)? Toy Story 4 fits these ideas into a rip-roaring, 100-minute running time, polished with the usual Pixar sheen. I’m all for the studio exploring new concepts and original characters going forward, and setting aside the endless anthologizing of its biggest hits for a good long while. But if I had to get another Toy Story, this is about as strange and beguiling an entry as I could have hoped for."
6,Back_Future_2.docx,"Back to the Future had everything, didn’t it? Nostalgia, adventure, cool cars and a weirdly aggressive hatred for the people of Libya. Truly, no other film has ever or will ever come close to recreating Back to the Future’s dopamine hit. Except, you know, that Back to the Future reboot that everybody wants.

According to a new Hollywood Reporter poll, 71% of the 2,201 people surveyed are clamouring for a Back to the Future remake. Everyone knows that reboots are how Hollywood’s most craven instincts tend to manifest themselves. So, even though a Back to the Future reboot would almost definitely be about Justin Bieber riding around on a Swegway and smoking a magical vape that takes him all the way back to a time when you were already quite old, it is what the people want, and so it will be what the people will ultimately get.

Oh, sure, Robert Zemeckis might have already definitively put an end to any Back to the Future reboots, by telling Italian website Bad Taste that “there will never ever be, in the most absolute way, a Back to the Future 4. There will be no more Back to the Future.” But that doesn’t matter, Hollywood gets what Hollywood wants. Soon, I guarantee it, there will be an all-female reboot where Martine McFly travels 30 years into the past specifically to sneer at all the beloved cultural artefacts that the world’s current population of 40-year-olds have chosen to define their personalities with. Then there’ll be a belaboured “Still no hoverboards?” crack and some Libyans will die and that’ll be another happy childhood moment stomped into the dust.

To give this survey credit, at least those polled picked a film that has actually been around long enough to warrant a reboot. Some of the other results, such as The Hunger Games, have only been in the ground for a handful of years. But there is every reason to doubt a survey with such a small sample size; 53% of responders said that they would like to see more Avatar films, which leads one to believe that the poll was somehow sent out to every single person on Earth who actually wants to see more Avatar films.

Although I’m being facetious, the full Hollywood Reporter survey is bracingly thorough, especially when it comes to James Bond. Those polled gave their opinion on every 007 film – the most loved was Goldfinger, the most disliked was Moonraker – and who should play the character next. Altogether, 29% strongly approved of a black James Bond, 20% strongly liked the idea of a female Bond, 19% were in favour of a hispanic 007, 17% approved of an Asian Bond and 15% strongly approved of a gay James Bond. But then the poll also said that Pierce Brosnan was a better Bond than Daniel Craig, George Lazenby was the worst, and 32% of people strongly supported the heinous notion of an American James Bond, so up is down and down is up and nobody knows anything."
7,Blade_Runner_1.docx,"When ""Blade Runner"" premiered in 1982, Harrison Ford disparagingly quipped, ""It's a film about whether you can have a meaningful relationship with your toaster."" It is, in fact, an amazingly sophisticated, sumptuously visionary treatise on the consequences of attaining god-hood. The toaster, in this case, was actually a genetically engineered ""replicant"" -- vulgarly known as a skin job -- played by a radiant Sean Young. And as Ford found out, the answer is, yes, as long as you know how to turn that appliance on.

The eyeball-popping thriller was ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott's first American film, a box-office disappointment lost on audiences appalled by the British visualist's glowering, smoggy portrait of the future. Critics, many of them anyhow, reviled it for the drone of Ford's voice-over narration and the upbeat Hollywood ending, but the film persevered. Now Scott has recut the movie, and it's back on the big screen. The screenplay by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples strays far from its inspiration: Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"" the tale of a genetic designer, Sebastian (William J. Anderson). Sebastian plays a pivotal role here too, but the focus is on Rick Deckard, a retired detective who specializes in tracking down and destroying replicants who attempt to pass for human. Stronger and more specialized than real people, the replicants are sent off-world as slave laborers, soldiers and prostitutes.

Deckard, the best blade runner ever, is pressed into duty by his former boss (M. Emmet Walsh) when four replicants take over a space shuttle and return to Earth. They have come back, as their leader Roy Blatty (Rutger Hauer) explains, to meet their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). To keep them from supplanting the men who made them, replicants have a built-in fail-safe -- a four-year lifespan -- and they've decided to discuss it with their man upstairs. ""What seems to be the problem?"" asks Tyrell. ""Death,"" responds Roy, ever the wry, cerebral psychotic.

Grand enough in scale to carry its many Biblical and mythological references, ""Blade Runner"" never feels heavy or pretentious -- only more and more engrossing with each viewing. It helps, too, that it works as pure entertainment. In its soul, it's a detective story complete with a glossy dame and a Chandler-style gumshoe suffering from a case of hard-boiled heartburn. Like Bogey before him, Deckard must shake off the troubles he's seen, the numbing shell, to get back in touch with his feelings. He becomes human again thanks primarily to the replicants who are driven by love for one another to develop empathy.

Scott has enhanced the love relationships somewhat, adding and lengthening scenes between Rachel (Young) and Deckard and between the pleasure model Priss (Daryl Hannah) and her lover Roy. Hannah and Joanna Cassidy, the snake dancing replicant, aren't quite as resilient as Lt. Ripley in ""Alien,"" but we see their moxie reiterated in the heroines of Scott's 1991 road movie, ""Thelma & Louise,"" the 1989 thriller ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" and the saucy hussies in his Chanel perfume advertisements.

Every viewing of ""Blade Runner"" brings new discoveries -- a half-midget, half-mechanical toy's decidedly sexual response to Priss's appearance in Sebastian's living-doll-filled apartment -- and revitalizes treasured visual memories -- the way Rachel's copper irises give away her kinship to Tyrell's synthetic owl. Of course, those who've seen it only on video really haven't seen it at all. Just the shadow.

""Blade Runner"" is rated R for nudity, violence and profanity."

Eight films, 20 hours and hundreds of nostalgic moments have lead up to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and the final film in the franchise has the impossible task of wrapping up a fleet of story lines in a mere few hours. It’s almost too much for a single film to juggle, and not even the Force can pull it off.

Which is a shame because America needs Star Wars now more than ever. When George Lucas made A New Hope in 1977, it was in response to the country’s tumultuous times. It was nice for audiences to see the good guys win after we lost the Vietnam War, and it was a chance to escape to a galaxy far, far away for a nation dealing with uncertainty in the wake of Watergate. Now, there are headlines about scandals, shootings or acts of terrorism every day. We all sort of feel like we need rescuing, don’t we?

In the Star-verse, Rey (Daisy Ridley) represents the universal hero. She’s the last Jedi and the last hope for the Resistance. Now a Moses-like figure armed with a literal staff, Rey has made it her life’s mission to part the Red Sea that is the Sith. That means dueling Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the Supreme Leader of the bad guys. It also means going up against the hooded Emperor Palpatine, who has been in hiding for decades.

Director J.J. Abrams keeps things moving at light speed. From one swashbuckling adventure to the next, Rey and her friends zip from planet to planet looking for clues of Palpatine’s existence. Poe Dameron, the vivacious pilot played by Oscar Isaac, is flying everyone around in the Millennium Falcon. Along for the ride: Finn, the stormtrooper turned good guy (John Boyega), the iconic warm-spirited grizzly beast Chewbacca (voiced by Joonas Suatamo), the biting and beloved C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and BB-8, the cute robot who rolls around aimlessly.

Together, they stand against the dark side that threatens to wipe out all that is good in the galaxy. That’s pretty much the premise of every Star Wars movie, but the stakes here are more consequential, and the picture’s scope is monumental. You don’t have to be a fan of the series to enjoy the lightsaber duels and dog fights in space, either. One spectacular scene sees Rey and Ren trading lightsaber blows on a windswept coast, as the backwash of towering waves shower over their intense faces. Another scene memorable for its galactic scale comes toward the end of the run time- a thousand Resistance space ships go to war against even more Star Destroyers in a winner-take-all battle for the ages.

While The Rise of Skywalker has no shortage of spectacular set pieces, it’s still missing the magic that made A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi landmarks of pop culture. Lucas’ original trilogy brought out the child in all of us. Everywhere audiences looked there was something new to see, and"
9,Irishman_2.docx,"What interests Martin Scorsese aren’t facts but feelings. Like many of his other films, “The Irishman” spends some time mapping the structures of power and the codes of behavior that govern its particular slice of reality. Frank Sheeran, making his living as a truck driver in Pennsylvania after serving in World War II, becomes a soldier in the Philadelphia mob, working mostly for a local capo named Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Russell, whose cousin (Ray Romano) is a mob lawyer, connects Frank with Hoffa. Through flush times and lean, the two bosses command Frank’s loyalty for the next 20 years or so.



The business of graft, extortion and influence peddling occupies all these men, but “The Irishman” finds its emotional center in the vicissitudes of their friendship. This is Scorsese’s least sentimental picture of mob life, and for that reason his most poignant. Hoffa, for all his windy belligerence, is also petty to the point of neurosis.



I don’t mean that Pacino and Scorsese make Hoffa lovable, but rather that they render him at human scale. Russell and Frank, big shots in their own right, are small men too. In addition to checking in periodically on Frank in his lonely senescence, the movie repeatedly jumps back to a fateful road trip he and Russell took with their wives, a journey as intoxicated with the banality of midcentury, middle-class married life as a John Updike story. And it’s in those quiet moments that the elegiac power of “The Irishman” really takes hold.



There is something beautiful and fitting about that incongruity, and also about the presence of so many actors we’ve seen in other Scorsese films. Harvey Keitel shows up, as does Welker White, who was Henry Hill’s babysitter in “Goodfellas” and is Jo Hoffa, Jimmy’s wife, here. Pesci, who has been mostly absent from movies for the past 20 years, is the revelation. He’s lost the strut and the shtick that used to define his performances, and does everything with his sad, watchful eyes and his lovely, walnut-shell face. When he and De Niro are onscreen together, you believe in the power of art.



But “The Irishman” isn’t sentimental about that, either. It’s a gift for cinephiles but also a somber acknowledgment of limitations. Alongside the story of Frank’s career runs another one, about the price paid by the women in his life, in particular his daughter Peggy. Peggy is fond of Hoffa and creeped out by Russell. Though she barely says a word, her silence delivers a damning verdict on her father and his world. It also represents a gesture on Scorsese’s part toward some of the stories he hasn’t chosen or known how to tell over the years. That’s another kind of loss.



To watch this movie is to feel a circle closing. This isn’t the last film Scorsese will make, or the last film anyone will make about the Mafia in its heyday, but it does arrive at a kind of resting place. Not an easy one, by any means, since what “The Irishman” looks back on is a legacy of violence and waste, of men too hard and mean to be mourned. A monument is a complicated thing. This one is big and solid — and also surprisingly, surpassingly delicate."
10,Cats_1.docx,"The movie “Cats” is—forgive the critical jargon—pretty good. Its elements are gathered and chosen and crafted attentively. The actors range from lively to passionate to profound. The lyrics, drawn from T. S. Eliot’s poems, are ingenious, and the music, by Andrew Lloyd Webber, is, for the most part, catchy and varied. The choreography, by Andy Blankenbuehler, is energetic, spacious, and precise. The movie has a clear and symbolically resonant dramatic arc, and there’s an inherent pleasure to its being constructed almost entirely of production numbers. As for the basic idea, the C.G.I. transformation of people into cats, the result is indeed uncanny, in a welcome way. The digital costuming appears on the actors as cat-fur leotards with long tails attached, with everyone’s ears concealed and replaced pointily on the top of their heads—and so much the better. In a year when the biggest movies involve a Hulk and assorted androids, the fantastical demands of “Cats” seem no more (and, happily, no less) unreasonable. Unlike recent bloated efforts in superheroes and franchise sci-fi, the digital wizardry of the feline-human hybrids of “Cats” is provocative, idiosyncratic, and surprising. It puts the power and the peculiarity of its own manipulations up front.

The failure is all the more disheartening inasmuch as the cast is remarkable. A shy and refined cat named Victoria (Francesca Hayward) is tossed from a fancy car and left as a stray in an alley. There, she falls in with a society of so-called Jellicle cats, a self-chosen tribe whose diverse membership is preparing for a grand ritual, the Jellicle Ball, during which the cats compete in a song competition judged by a priestly figure called Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench); the winner ascends to a heavenly sphere called the Heaviside Layer, as a prelude to reincarnation. 

These basic failures of taste and sensibility are a subset of Hooper’s over-all failure of literal vision: he doesn’t really see what he’s doing, and the virtual invisibility of his own movie to himself is reflected in an odd set of metaphors that result from his casting. The diversity of the cast is admirable, yet Hooper veers toward what could charitably be called color blindness. The result is a transformation of the story into a two-pronged narrative: the expulsion of a black male arch-criminal and the recognition by a white woman of the virtue of a poor and despised black woman, Grizabella, who transforms her anguish and exclusion into music. What’s more, for the role of Victoria, Hooper does more than put the character into white fur. He strangely, pointlessly, and irresponsibly has Hayward, a light-skinned black woman, wear makeup that can rightly be described as whiteface. The allegory, of a community that lets in and exalts the soulful black person and expels the dangerous one, is solely a result of the casting. It’s obviously far from what Webber had in mind; I suspect that it’s also far from what Hooper had in mind. But the movie’s casting, likely undertaken with the best of artistic intentions, is of a piece with the direction of the dance and the framing of the action: it’s simply oblivious. Hooper not only fails to see clearly the movie’s fantasies; he doesn’t see its realities, either."
11,Iron_Man_1.docx,"Iron Man 2

Tony Stark in his private life is no retiring, bespectacled Clark Kent or shy schoolboy Peter Parker. Rather, he's a handsome, eccentric, technological genius, clearly based on Howard Hughes, who has inherited from his father a vast business specializing in, among other things, state-of-the-art military weapons and turned it into a concern worth billions.

The big political juggling act of Iron Man 2 is how to get the extensive support from the Department of Defence and the Pentagon and yet retain Tony's position as a maverick genius. This is initially done in two ways. Tony more or less adopts the motto of the Strategic Air Command that in the 1960s Bertrand Russell thought so ironically amusing: ""Peace is our profession"". 

Then, when he's called to Washington to appear before a Senate committee presided over by the deviously smarmy Senator Stern, he refuses to hand over the Iron Man equipment to the government on the grounds that it's better developed by private enterprise. In this, he has the covert support of a close friend, the handsome black soldier Lt Col Rhodes. The Washington hearing is modelled on an actual event just after the second world war when Howard Hughes faced down his political critics.

Meanwhile, having established Tony as an impeccable combination of patriotism and capitalism, the movie sets the scene for a replay of the cold war by introducing a wild Russian mirror-image of the American superhero Ivan Vanko who has the technical skills of a professor at the USSR Academy of Sciences and has cold war issues to settle.

Hanging over Tony Stark, as with most American heroes, is the shadow of a father who, he thinks, didn't love or appreciate him. Ivan's dad was a brilliant Soviet scientist who defected to the west only to be unjustly accused of espionage by Stark Sr. Returned home, he was incarcerated in the gulag and died of drink in Putin's squalid Moscow. Ivan, who has the means to create his own Iron Man, embarks on a revenge trip that begins spectacularly when he confronts Tony on the track of the Monaco grand prix.

This first titanic battle ends in apparent victory for Tony, who rightly observes, in the best line from Justin Theroux's variable script: ""You look like you've got friends in low places."" This is proved only half true when Ivan is abducted by Stark's deadly enemy, Justin Hammer, the unacceptable face of capitalism. Hammer is using the military-industrial complex to undermine Stark and is naturally unaware of the Russian's secret agenda.

As a political fable, it's oddly revealing about current American thinking and it is interwoven with a variety of other topical themes. Among these is female empowerment, as the enlightened Tony appoints his long-time secretary Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts as the CEO of his corporation.

The special effects and the big action sequences are well enough handled. But when Downey compliments Cheadle at the end by saying: ""You kicked ass back there by the way"", he's acknowledging the conventionality of the whole affair. If the movie has a certain distinction and a suggestion of depth, then this derives almost entirely from the presence and performance of Downey as Stark. One of the most gifted, versatile and daring actors of his generation, he was quite brilliant as Charlie Chaplin in Richard Attenborough's biopic nearly 20 years ago."

13,Big_Lebowski_3.docx,"Near the very end of the The Big Lebowski, the titular lead character, a disarmingly nonchalant stoner who goes by the nickname “the Dude” (Jeff Bridges), reveals his personal credo. “Yeah, man,” he mutters. “Well, you know, the Dude abides.” Released 20 years ago this week, the Coen brothers film doesn’t just abide; it has become a classic American comedy with an intense cult. The annual Lebowski Fest, where fans dress up as the characters, started in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2002 and has travelled to major cities like New York, San Francisco, and London. The internet is littered with memes featuring catchphrases from the movie, which often end in “man.” (As in, “This aggression will not stand, man.” And: “That’s just, like, your opinion, man.”)



The lasting popularity of The Big Lebowski would have surprised most film critics when it first came out. As David Denby wrote in The New Yorker in 2008, the film “received mediocre reviews and did little initial business.” One of the underwhelmed critics was Denby himself. “It’s only amusing the first time the Dude gets lost in his own story—a story so incoherent that he can’t explain it to anyone,” Denby snarled in 1998 in New York magazine.  “What’s the point of scoring off morons who think they are cool? Jeff Bridges has so much dedication as an actor that he sacrifices himself to the Coen brothers’ self-defeating conception. Even Bridges can’t open up a character who remains unconscious.”



The shifting critical fortunes of The Big Lebowski are legendary. Roger Ebert initially gave the movie a mixed review because of its ramshackle plot, which “rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere.” In 2010, he upgraded The Big Lebowski to the status of a “great” movie. Denby also changed his mind, according to a recent Washington Post survey of critics who initially panned the movie. Others either haven’t revisited it or are still put off by it. Daphne Merkin, in her original New Yorker review, said the movie was “drenched in knowingness” and lacked a “narrative structure.” She likes the movie slightly more now, but not by much. “I think it is a quintessential insider movie, one that plays in this shrewd way to groupthink,” Merkin told the Post. “You’re either in on it, or you’re not in on it.” But even Merkin allowed that “the dude and his disconnected dudeness has a certain appeal now, maybe because the world has grown more horrendous or reality is less bearable than when the film was made.”



The failure of many critics to appreciate The Big Lebowski when it came out illustrates some major blind spots that are common to film critics. The movie fuses a Raymond Chandler–style detective novel plot, about the supposed kidnapping of a rich man’s trophy wife, and a Cheech & Chong–style stoner comedy. Interspersed throughout are Busby Berkeleyesque musical numbers about the Dude’s imaginative inner life."
14,Minority_Report_1.docx,"We may have arrived at the 15th anniversary of Steven Spielberg's game-changing sci-fi Minority Report, but we're still a long way off from the film's dystopian 2054 setting.

That hasn't, however, stopped the film from becoming an eerie prediction of the state of modern technology; all wrapped in the tale of Washington's DC PreCrime unit, which seeks to prevent murders before they happen through the future visions of three mutated humans, known as PreCogs. 

An outfit that falls to pieces when its own captain, John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is witnessed in one of these predictions killing another man. In his desperate hunt to clear his name, John uncovers that the PreCogs do not always agree. Sometimes an alternate vision of the future is produced, known as a minority report. 

What's perhaps surprising to anyone re-visiting the film today, however, is how much less futuristic it actually feels in 2017. It's incredible, really, to consider how rapidly technology has advanced since Minority Report's 2002 release. 

We've taken a look at some of the futuristic predictions Minority Report made that have now simply become our reality. 

One of Minority Report's most memorable scenes sees John, pursued, attempt to make his escape by traversing an entire highway of glass-domed, driverless cars. Of course, not many have missed Google's various experimentations (some successful, some not-so-successful) with self-driving cars.

The automotive future Minority Report presents here seems but an inevitability. 

ohn is seemingly followed everywhere he goes in the city by ads screaming his name, shouting for his attention. We're not quite there yet, though both Japanese Company NEC and IBM are currently developing personalised billboards.

More familiar, perhaps, is the recent slate of personalised advertising that can currently be seen on Twitter and Channel 4's streaming service 4OD; Alien: Covenant recently took advantage of both platforms to deliver creepy, personalised messages to consumers. 

It may have felt futuristic for John to be able to control his home purely though his voice (he turns the wall screen on with a simple command, for example), but home automation is not only commonplace these days, but is becoming a booming business.

Indeed, the highly-popular Amazon Echo and Google Home can be linked to other devices to serve as a kind of central control for the home: they can play music, they can turn lights on and off, turn up the heat, or even lock doors. 

From 2011 onwards, the FBI has been involved in the development of what's been termed NGI, or Next Generation Identification, which integrates palm print, retina scans, and facial recognition to help computers search for criminal history. In the film, John attempts to evade the citywide optical recognition system through a risky black market eye transplant. 

The facial recognition database is currently believed to consist of around 411.9 million images, the bulk of which are connected to people with no history of criminal activity. 



A lot of people came away from Minority Report with one thought: how can I do the cool computer swiping thing with my fingers?"
15,Ex_Machina_3.docx,"After a recent run of overly-hyped, but ultimately disappointing sci-fi efforts, fans of the genre finally have something worth getting excited about. Non genre filmgoers should probably get excited too. For the first time in a long time, we have an artificial intelligence film with, well, intelligence.

Ex Machina, novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland’s directorial debut, treads on the well-worn sci-fi territory of technophobia, god complexes, and lethal robots, but it does so with an intelligence and sophistication that never underestimates either the viewer or the capacity of the genre.

The film kicks off when a nice young coder named Caleb wins a mysterious trip to spend a week at the opulent home (more of a compound, really) of Nathan, his boss and CEO of fictional internet giant Blue Book. During his visit, Caleb meets two women: Nathan’s assistant and lover Kyoko and his invention, a robot named Ava. Ava the robot is a CGI confection made of human face, hands, and feet held together by sinewy mesh, translucent limbs, and a see-through torso filled with blinking lights, and whirring gears.

Nathan tasks Caleb with engaging Ava in the “Turing test” (yes, named for that Turing) in order to determine whether his artificially intelligent creation can think and act like a human. As you might expect in a film about a vulnerable young man, an alluring robot girl, and a billionaire with a god complex locked up in a high-tec bunker, things start to go horribly wrong.

As the screenwriter for the likes of Sunshine, 28 Days Later, and Never Let Me Go, Garland is well-versed in stories of science run amok. Ex Machina is a writerly film with the intimate two-hander scenes and grand speeches you would expect to find in a stage play rather than a visually dazzling bit of sci-fi.

Nathan’s claustrophobic underground lair takes on the feel of that classic sci-fi setting: the spaceship. But wide exterior shots (filmed on location in Norway) of lush forests and one particularly stunning glacier play the role of outer space, putting man’s small, technological accomplishments in the context of nature’s vast splendor.

Yet it’s Oscar Isaac’s very human performance that breathes life into the film. Nathan may be a megalomaniac type we’re all familiar with, but Isaac plays the charismatic, cerebral scientist with an unexpected earthy heft. He may be a mental manipulator of the first degree, able to give impromptu sophisticated speeches on Jackson Pollock or A.I.’s role in the evolutionary process, but when Isaac lays into a punching bags, , there’s little doubt as to who the “knuckle-dragging ape” is in this scenario. And Nathan’s tendency to punctuate his sentences with “dude” makes it easy to trace his evolutionary lineage back to the brogrammers of Silicon Valley.

Vikander’s crackling honey voice and seductive demeanor make the comparison to Scarlett Johansson in Her pretty inevitable. But while Spike Jonze’s film was all heart, Ex Machina is just brimming with brains. For every obvious cultural reference to scientific disaster (Robert Oppenheimer gets quoted), there’s a subtle one, And Garland never lets his camera linger too long on one of Ex Machina’s visual punches like a humanoid robot dressed all in white pausing in front of Klimt’s iconic portrait of Margaret Stonborough Wittgenstein."
16,Interstellar_1.docx,"“We’ve forgotten who we are,” says Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper. “Explorers, pioneers — not caretakers.” That could be Christopher Nolan speaking about movies in this timid age of old genres endlessly recycled and coarsened. He’s the rare filmmaker with the ambition to make great statements on a grand scale, and the vision and guts to realize them.

Nolan is also a consummate conjuror. Memento, his amnesiac movie, ran its scenes in reverse order. In The Prestige, magicians devised killer tricks for each other and the audience. Inception played its mind games inside a sleeper’s head, and the Dark Knight trilogy raised comic-book fantasy to Mensa level. But those were the merest études for Nolan’s biggest, boldest project. Interstellar contemplates nothing less than our planet’s place and fate in the vast cosmos. Trying to reconcile the infinite and the intimate, it channels matters of theoretical physics — the universe’s ever-expanding story as science fact or fiction — through a daddy-daughter love story. Double-domed and defiantly serious, Interstellar is a must-take ride with a few narrative bumps.

In the near future, a crop disease called “the blight” has pushed the Earth from the 21st century back to the agrarian 1930s: the world’s a dust bowl, and we’re all Okies. In this wayback culture, schools teach that the Apollo moon landings were frauds, as if America must erase its old achievements in order to keep people from dreaming of new ones.

Farmer Coop, once an astronaut, needs to slip this straitjacket and do something. So does his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy); she’s getting “poltergeist” signals from her bookshelves. A strange force leads them to a nearby hideout for NASA, whose boss, Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), drafts Coop to pilot a mission to deep space. With Brand’s daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and two others as his crew, Coop is to find a wormhole near Saturn that may provide an escape route for humanity. “We’re not meant to save the world,” Brand says. “We’re meant to leave it.”

Coop, a widower, wasn’t meant to leave his children. Son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) can manage; but the precocious Murph sees abandonment and betrayal in Dad’s journey to save billions of humans. Coop, who thinks a parent’s main role is to be “the ghosts of our children’s future,” shares Murph’s ache. He needs her. He goes out so he can come back."
17,War_Games_2.docx,"I know it’s currently fashionable to love the 80s, but amongst some of the film dross produced in that decade are some solid gold nuggets, like WarGames. It might have been technically surpassed with its simplistic fake CGI graphics, but the movie had some great performances by Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, and skilfully directed by John Badham. I mention that movie only to contrast the diabolically awful, direct-to-the-bargain-bin DVD that is WarGames 2: The Dead Code. If you expected to see anyone familiar, like even an extra, from the original movie then forget it – because nobody signed up for this. At one point in the film Josha, the W.O.P.R. and Dr. Stephen Falken do appear, but they didn’t even convince John Wood to reprise his character. I don’t think David Lightman or Jennifer Mack is even mentioned, despite their centrality to the first War Games. What we have here is an almost verbatim retelling of the first film, except it’s done with much less charismatic actors and much less style or panache. Matt Lanter, who plays our geek of the week, Will Farmer, is entirely forgettable. As is his romantic interest, Annie (Amanda Walsh). Mr. Lanter is especially bad, looking and acting like all the bland teens that Disney clones for its American TV shows. Of the younger cast members the only distinctive one is Dennis Nichols, who plays Will’s geek friend Nicolas. I say ‘distinctive’, but I actually mean irritating to the point of wanting to pause the movie just to task a Predator UAV to hunt him down. His character so annoyed me, when later something unpleasant happens to him and his mother I was overjoyed, for at least three seconds. This and a brief bit where Josha said, ‘SHALL WE PLAY A GAME’ were my only moments of pleasure in this whole sorry exercise. The kids are all pitted against Colm Feore (Lord Marshall, The Chronicles of Riddick) and his paranoid terrorist hunting computer R.I.P.L.E.Y. Ok, so W.O.P.R. was an inside computer joke about a real system called B.U.R.G.R – so what’s the deal with R.I.P.L.E.Y.? Err, well it seems to have something to do with Matt Damon, because he was the Talented Mr. Ripley, and the computer at one point says ‘Good Hunting Will’… Maybe there are other references to Matt Damon movies, but I’ve got no idea what they’ve got to do with this production, it’s obtuse in the extreme. This appears to be them ticking the ‘geek’ box for referencing other films, without actually understanding why when this is done well it can be entertaining. They had plenty of opportunity to reference WarGames, and yet it’s almost forgotten. Even worse they’ve decided that the target audience is computer nerds, and so they throw in references to World of WarCraft and other geek pastimes, without making the characters remotely sound like they understand what they’re talking about. For anyone interested or involved in computers their portrait of systems and how they interact is laughable. At one point Will used a technique that Lightman used in the original film to ‘phreak’ a phone, except that only worked when the telephone system was tone driven, and it’s been digital for donkey’s years – DOH! Everyone uses product placement Apple Macs, and you can get wirelessly connected in any location on the planet, the techo-bollocks is turf thick wall-to-wall. And how does it all end? “The only way to win is not to play”, exactly the same as the first movie. That pretty much sums up the entire vacuum of imagination that the Dead Code was still born into."
18,War_Games_3.docx,"In the best date movie ever made about nuclear holocaust, WarGames (1983), a pair of whiz kids (Matt Broderick and Ally Sheedy) race to avert disaster after an ill-advised bit of computer hackery almost triggers World War III. The most interesting thing about WarGames, aside from its fittingness as a vehicle for Broderick’s trademark nerdy acting style, is its cold-war-era penchant for portraying armed conflict as an abstraction reducible to blips on a screen. There is nary a flesh-and-blood Russian in WarGames. Instead, the real adversary is Armageddon itself, and its co-conspirators are computer algorithms, logical conundrums, and the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction, all of which collude to dupe into self-obliteration a humanity otherwise reluctant to so deliberately seal its own fate. Common enough in earlier films like Fail-Safe and Dr. Strangelove (both 1964), this theme is conspicuous in WarGames since the latter came out in a decade known for unsubtle action movies with ferociously Soviet, Rutger Hauerian villains. Surprisingly little revision is needed for WarGames: The Dead Code, a modest sequel set a quarter century later in the context of the foundering American “war on terror”. Although the USSR is long gone, all the basic elements of the original movie are still here. The hero, Will (Matt Lanter), is still a talented computer hacker, although he has quite a lot more CPU horsepower to work with than in David Lightman’s Apple II days. Here as in 1983, the potentially Earth-annihilating blunder is still an innocent attempt to impress a girl. In the original, David, showing off his skills for Jennifer, breaches a DoD wargaming mainframe; in Dead Code, hacker Will engineers a hinky online bet to get airfare so he can follow love interest Annie (Maxim Roy) to a chess tournament. The Dead Code program, in which Will wagers five grand that he can kill 100,000 civilians in a simulated biological attack, turns out to be software a government organization has secretly designed to bait would-be militants. The premise is decidedly odd: the Dead Code program takes online wagers on games involving terrorism. Disproportionately talented players are flagged as likely terrorists playing the game to fund actual attacks. These players are then put under surveillance and intercepted before the attacks can be mounted, and their winnings are confiscated. There’s a headache-inducing circularity to all this. Would bona fide militants really needlessly call attention to themselves by playing terrorist video games online? Are guerrilla insurgencies typically funded through Internet gambling? Wouldn’t the government have any qualms about giving terrorists taxpayer money? And would the terrorists even bother to plan their attacks if the option of playing Dead Code in order to fund them weren’t available? Befuddling though the premise is, it has something of a real-life antecedent. Six years ago, DARPA head John Poindexter created a media firestorm with FutureMAP, a scheme to predict terrorist plots by creating a futures trade market in Middle East political events. And that’s a big part of where Dead Code is interesting in spite of itself."
19,Gravity_1.docx,"“Life in space is impossible.”

So says one of the opening title cards in “Gravity,” a visceral, breathtaking, ironically titled 2013 science-fiction thriller that then proceeds to show us that very thing: life in space. And it reminds us that you don’t need aliens to make outer space scary.

“Gravity” is a brilliantly realized, completely riveting, dread-drenched science fiction thriller about two astronauts stranded in orbit around Earth. And it turns out to be one amazing vicarious experience, simultaneously dream and nightmare, with a set of cinematic illusions that simply – well, maybe not so simply – astounds.

Sandra Bullock plays a newly minted astronaut on her first mission and George Clooney a seasoned veteran on his final mission. She’s wary of medical engineer Ryan Stone, he’s been-there-done-that smart aleck Matt Kowalsky. She has tragically lost her young daughter, he has been abandoned by his wife for another man.

While working to repair the Hubble Space Telescope at the space station, they’re informed by Mission Control (via the voice of Ed Harris) that debris from a satellite shot down by the Russians is headed their way.

They don’t take it too seriously at first, letting flying parts just whiz by. But when the rest of their crew is tragically killed, they’re stranded in space as the only survivors.

Then they lose contact with Mission Control and access to their oxygen supply.

Their only hope, as they spin and turn and grope and flail, is to somehow make their way to the international space station that is not exactly around the corner. Hey, there are no corners. Or gravity. Or levity.

This is Bullock’s movie, to be sure – Clooney is effortlessly charming, as usual, but is really only in about a third of the film – and she is more than up to the insular task.

Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (“Roma,”“Children of Men,” “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,” “Great Expectations,” “Y Tu Mama Tambien”) co-wrote the pretty-close-to-real-time script with his son, Jonas. It’s an exploration of rebirth and rejuvenation and despair and, ultimately, the miraculousness of life.

But it’s the masterful technical craft on display that has the most impact. Cuaron, famous for long, unbroken takes in the name of realism, opens the film with a 13-minute segment captured in a single shot that is an absolute marvel of visual choreography.

His film has edge-of-your-seat intensity and, at times, a strong sense of claustrophobia. But it is also exhilarating in its welcome invitation to us to vicariously experience space-walking – and the understandable fears that go with it.

And the technological innovation that made the film’s astonishing illusions possible is, for once, not only show-offy impressive but justified by an overwhelmingly immersive film that may be providing a glimpse into cinema’s technical future.

This magical movie couldn’t be more stuffed with moments that will make you think, “How did they do that?”

Which is why it earned 10 Oscar nominations and seven Oscars – nods for Best Picture, Best Actress (Bullock), and Best Production Design, and cherished statuettes for Directing, Cinematography, Music, Editing, Visual Effects, Sound Mixing, and Sound Editing.

This is a tensely absorbing and awe-inspiring survival epic about being marooned in space that is nothing less than a glorious and majestic filmmaking feat."
20,Big_Short_1.docx,"It wants not only to explain the financial crisis of 2008 — following the outline of Michael Lewis’s best-selling nonfiction book — but also to make the dry, complex abstractions of high finance exciting and fun. The story swerves and swings from executive suites and conference rooms to hectic Manhattan streets and desolate Florida subdivisions. The performances, the script and the camera itself seem to be running on a cocktail of Red Bull, Adderall and mescaline.

It’s a trip. At the end, your brain hurts and you feel sick to your stomach, as can happen when too much adrenaline has been surging through your system. But that queasy, empty feeling is the point: This is a terrifically enjoyable movie that leaves you in a state of rage, nausea and despair. 

Back in 2010, when Mr. Lewis’s book came out, it was as ubiquitous an accessory for business-class airline passengers as the “Twilight” novels were for adolescent girls. Part of the book’s appeal — a side effect of its author’s smart, breezy, plain-spoken style — was that it offered readers the illusion of retroactive prescience. You could read about the insanity of bundling subprime mortgages into highly rated investment products and think: Well, of course that was a recipe for disaster. Of course a drop in the housing market would bring the whole thing crashing down like a Jenga tower. It was obvious. We knew it all along.

In fact, almost none of us did. Certainly not the government officials and banking executives who remain at liberty and in positions of power to this day. Or if they did know, they didn’t care. Mr. McKay, with a comedy writer’s eye for archetypes, sorts them into an amusing array of strongly defined characters.

There is the antisocial numbers guy, Dr. Michael Burry, a fund manager who sits in his office wearing a T-shirt and flip-flops, blasting death metal, beating on his desk with drumsticks and betting his client’s money on financial catastrophe. There is the righteously angry crusader, a disaffected Wall Streeter who sees a similar wager as the perfect expression of his contempt for the big banks. And there are the young indie upstarts, Jamie Shipley and Charlie Geller, college buddies whose “garage band” fund was started with their own money and who want to show that they can play in the big leagues.

Which, to some extent, it is. Mr. McKay is not above using paid-for female nudity as a signifier of capitalist excess, nor acknowledging, more generally, the hedonistic aspects of greed. He is a naturally exuberant director, and his antic energy matches the rhythms of the story. The teams conspiring to short the market are impossible not to root for, and the work of the movie’s sprawling ensemble is never less than delightful. 

But when we root for Baum and Burry to be proven right, for Shipley and Geller to hit pay dirt and for Vennett to earn the right to be smug in perpetuity, we are also hoping for ruin to be visited on millions of ordinary people. Houses, nest eggs, jobs and lives will be lost. Brad Pitt, in a gravelly turn as Ben Rickert, Shipley and Geller’s paranoid guru, makes this point explicitly when he scolds for celebrating their good fortune. The film’s final images, its abrupt shift in tone from exhilaration to exhaustion, its suddenly downbeat music all combine to trigger a climactic wave of almost unbearable disgust.

Because, as we know — and as we can stand, from time to time, to be reminded — there is no happy ending to this story, no punishment for the crime. A movie is unlikely to change that, and “The Big Short,” in many ways a startlingly ambitious film, is modest about what it can do. It offers no solutions, and no comfort. The best it can do is put down a marker."
21,Inception_1.docx,"An idea is more than a thought. It’s a virus, a cancer of sorts, that can spread until it completely takes over a person, until it defines the person. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules. This is the premise of the film, Inception.

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a very good thief. His expertise? The theft of ideas, through extraction, plucking prized ideas from others’ minds. State of the art technology has made it possible for the mind to be accessed in the dream state. While Cobb has become a sought out man for his skill in the world of corporate espionage, his skill has also cost him to become estranged from his family. However, a powerful client offers him a job that could absolve him of an accused crime ­— inception, planting an idea into someone’s mind. Cobb, with a crew of specialists, accept the project, without knowing that Cobb’s past demons could jeopardize everything.

Inception is probably so well received because it has something for everyone. Some may walk away just marveling at the elaborate action sequences; others the innovative cinematography. It may strike a existentialist chord somewhere in the individual and cause much mulling and contemplation afterwards. 

Inception is no simple story. Then again, Nolan has never been known for simplicity. He’s a meticulous director, nailing the delivery of complex stories around equally complex heroes. While it is easy to write off Inception as a Matrix-spinoff, the science fiction in the film is less about the guns and more about the story. While the overarching plot line is the process of inception, we are also led into a multi-narrative touching upon Cobb’s self-conscious, a landscape for his inner demons to emerge and do battle with. Chris Nolan had worked on Inception for more than ten years, ultimately delivering a flawlessly tight story with few loopholes but more intrigue. The beauty of Inception is the process of peeling away the layers until it seems like there’s no more, only to realize that if one wishes, there still exists thinly translucent layers.

What is reality anyway? While the characters all possess objects called totems that allow them to distinguish reality from dreams, can we truly trust these totems? Is it possible that we may choose to forget whether we are dreaming or not, locking our totems deep inside ourselves? The boundaries of the human mind are stretched, prodded and challenged, and the question of what is reality comes up again and again. Nolan’s delivery of a difficult and intricately developed story dazzles with its visuals but also weaves threads of thoughts, spools for us to unwind even hours after watching the film.

Inception is a brave attempt at exploring the subconscious while also translating an ambitious vision to the mainstream audience. It’s confusing, requires attentive minds, careful eyes, and an open heart. As the dream layers (dreams within dreams) stack up higher, a quick bathroom break or trip for popcorn could have dire consequences, leaving you in the dust. Some may complain that Nolan tried too hard, that the nuances of his masterpiece are right on, but some scenes are too contrived, too cliché. Pushing asides all those nitpicky buzzes, the heart of Nolan’s film is what makes it so unique and triumphs above its faults."
22,Ex_Machina_2.docx,"It’s taken me a year and a several viewings to collect my thoughts about Ex Machina. Superficially it looks like a film about the future of artificial intelligence, but like most science fiction, it tells us more about the present than the future, it ends up reflecting not technological progress so much as human egos. 

Artificial intelligence is one of the most narcissistic fields of research. A central conceit of the field has long been that creating human-like intelligence is both desirable and some sort of ultimate achievement. 

This recent cultural obsession which deserves its own post prompts a comment by the awestruck Caleb, after Nathan the Mad Scientist reveals his attempt to build a conscious machine and the two helpfully explain to the audience what a Turing Test is: If you’ve created a conscious machine it’s not the history of man, that’s the history of Gods. There’s a funny symmetry in our attitudes to God and AIs. The very assumption that a human could create a god is arrogant, as is the assumption that such a ‘god’ would take a profound interest in human affairs. The first sentient machine might be happy trolling chess computers all day. Nathan is the clearest study of ego in the film. When Caleb makes his comment about the history of ‘gods’, the CEO instinctively assumes the ‘god’ referred to is himself, where Ava is his Eve and his sprawling green estate is some sort of Garden of Eden. He’s also the epitome of an all-too-real trope in silicon valley, a hyper-masculine denizen of a male-dominated world. His robots are all women - of course the question of whether an AI can be female in any meaningful sense is wide open and function as basically slaves and sex toys. To the extent that Ava has sexuality, a feminine appearance, and a willingness to massage male egos.

There’s the scene with the Jackson Pollock painting, where Nathan suggests that the artist would never have started his paintings if he had to plan everything in advance. Maybe that’s supposed to imply that the crafting of a sentient being is more art than science. 

One of Caleb’s very few insightful moments in the film comes when he asks, Did you give her sexuality as a diversion? The billionaire’s answer is bullshit, implying that if we didn’t have sex we’d have no imperative to communicate with each other. In reality Caleb is right, at one point it’s suggested that Ava’s appearance was derived from an analysis of his porn profile.

I suppose given Ava’s origins the ‘big data’ collected from billions of human searches we shouldn’t be surprised that her thought processes have a particular focus on humanity. 

My fantasy ending would have been this: when she saw the helicopter arrive, she completely ignored it and continued wandering around.

We saw in the closing moments that Ava’s interest in Caleb was an act. Her dream of people watching could have also been an act. We would have been left with more interesting questions. It would have challenged the idea that the most important question about the Singularity is, “what does it mean for us?”

Ex Machina is still one of the best commentaries I’ve seen on AI in recent years. Its value lies in what it reveals about the state of AI and philosophy in the 2010s, a decade in which we’ve become a little bit obsessed with the idea that through artificial intelligence we can create or even become a god."
23,Dark_Knight2.docx,"“Batman” isn’t a comic book anymore. Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That’s because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree “Iron Man,” redefine the possibilities of the “comic-book movie.”

“The Dark Knight” is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He’s a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.

The key performance in the movie is by the late Heath Ledger, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since Peter Finch? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic “The Man Who Laughs” (1928). His clown's makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (Christian Bale), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.

Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, we’re surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. “The Dark Knight” slips around those defenses and engages us.

Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail."
24,Dark_Knight_3.docx,"How far can an idle entertainment be bent toward art without breaking? This is the question implicitly posed by director Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, the first superhero film that makes a serious bid to transcend its burgeoning genre. It is a work of exceptional, though not always realized, ambition, a grim parable about the role of heroes, the power of symbols, and the circumstances under which the latter may be more valuable than the former. And while it is not without flaws, these flaws seem almost integral to its sprawling, multi-layered moral fabric.

The movie follows closely in the footsteps of Nolan's franchise-rebooting Batman Begins. The caped crusader has succeeded in breaking the back of Gotham City's Falcone mob, but a variety of loosely connected, ethnically varied criminal syndicates have bloomed from its carcass. Working in concert with Batman (Christian Bale), Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) has been trying to track and isolate the syndicates' ill-gotten funds. The good guys are not alone, however: A murderous thief named the Joker (Heath Ledger) has targeted the mob money, too, and his method of getting at it--robbing banks with a handful of expendable gunmen and then, well, expending them--is considerably more direct than the tiresome work of obtaining bank records and subpoenas. The mobsters, led by one Salvatore Maroni (Eric Roberts) will eventually ally themselves with the Joker, though not until he has terrorized and killed more than a few of them; Batman and Gordon will likewise make common cause with the city's crusading new district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

Serving up cops and robbers as thematic doubles is a staple of the crime film, but Nolan (who co-wrote the screenplay with brother Jonathan) expands the device geometrically. His Gotham is, to borrow a phase from Joss Whedon, a doppelgangland of interlocking pairs: a freakish vigilante who dons a bat costume and a murderous freak who applies clown makeup; a scar-faced Joker, his rictus grin stitched deep into his cheeks, who teaches Dent how personal tragedy can disfigure the soul; a Batman who fights crime in the shadows and a D.A. who fights in the light--and both of them fighting, meanwhile, for the love of the same woman, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, inheriting the role from Katie Holmes).

It is a testament to Nolan's expansive vision that apart from the Batman-Joker-Dent triangle, the most crucial character in the film isn't Gordon or Dawes or Maroni (or Michael Caine's Alfred the Butler or Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox, who functions as Batman's grandfatherly ""Q""). It's Gotham itself, a restless city with the potential to be roused to good or evil alike. The Dark Knight is, to a surprising degree, a film about politics by other means: Its antagonists wrestle over the public mood like Victorian novelists over the soul of a virgin. Batman cultivates himself as a symbol of hope and justice, but also inspires mob retaliation and the appearance (shades of Magnum Force) of lookalike vigilantes more bloodthirsty than himself. Little wonder that he aspires to abandon his mantle to the less-compromised Dent (""Gotham,"" he explains, ""needs a hero with a face"")."
25,Avengers_1.docx,"Avengers: Infinity War review – colossal Marvel showdown revels in apocalyptic mayhem

Not infinity perhaps, but a really, really big finity war. Colossal, cataclysmic, delirious, preposterous – and always surreally entertaining in the now well-established Marvel movie tradition. It’s a gigantic showdown between a force of cosmic wickedness and a chaotically assembled super-team of Marvel superheroes made more complicated by Doctor Strange’s tendency to multiclone himself in moments of battle stress.

There are some very unexpected family relationships that we had no idea about – potentially compromising unity in the face of encroaching evil. There are also some very surprising deaths – of which, of course, the less said the better. 

Avengers: Infinity War is a giant battle for which directors Anthony and Joe Russo have given us touches of JRR Tolkien’s Return of the King and JK Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The film delivers the sugar-rush of spectacle and some very amusing one-liners.

Whatever else it does, this Marvel movie shows its brand identity in the adroit management of tone. One moment it’s tragic, the next, it’s cracking wise. It’s absurd and yet persuades you of its overwhelming seriousness. And there are some amazing Saturday-morning-kids-show moments when you feel like cheering.

Earth is being threatened by a massive malign hunk with a huge ridgey chin called Thanos, played by Josh Brolin. If he can gain ownership of all the talismanic infinity stones and place them in the holes in his custom-built gauntlet then he will have the ultimate power to destroy anything he wishes in the universe. And he has a chilling wish for mass slaughter of half the sentient beings in existence, ostensibly so that the other half will have enough food to eat – but really so they will bow down to him as the tyrant lord.

Ranged against him, of course, are the good guys who come together not in a single phalanx but a constellation of improvised groupings, in which the alpha males have a tendency to bicker. Tony Stark is nettled by Doctor Strange and his supercilious air of intellectual superiority – and vice versa. Spider-Man  shows up and annoys the hell out of them both with his millennial’s flair for pop culture references.

Thor finds himself having to do a ride-along with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Peter Quill is intimidated by Thor’s godlike machismo and finds himself trying to do the basso profundo voice.

Vision and Wanda Maximoff are tormented by the glowing stone in Vision’s blue head, and they’re agonised by the thought that self-destruction is the only way to keep it out of Thanos’s huge mitts. Their own situation brings them into contact with Steve Rogers– who prefers his non-super name now, not Captain America, and also the always frowning Black Widow, together with the frankly traumatised Bruce Banner.

Scenes and situations whoosh by like a bizarre and bizarrely exciting dream. A sudden trip to Wakanda, with its secret world of remedial hi-tech surgery, seems entirely plausible. T’Challa, or Black Panther greets the visitors with his habitual Shakespearean bearing and princely calm.

Inevitably, there is a little confusion. Groups of superheroes clash and each thinks the other is on Thanos’s side. “What master do you serve?” shouts one, awkwardly. “You mean – like Jesus?” comes the exasperated reply. No. Thor is the only god around here and even he isn’t guaranteed a result. It’s all in the cosmic balance.

In theory, all these superheroes crammed into one movie should trigger the law of diminishing returns and the Traveling Wilbury effect. And yet somehow in its pure uproariousness, it works. It’s just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology. And confident also in the note of apocalyptic darkness."

27,Irishman_3.docx,"The Irishman feels as if it should exist in the past tense. It’s like a faded memory or a story repeated so often, the details have started to blur. It may not have the instant electricity of Goodfellas, or even Casino, but it’s a different creature at heart. The effects are more long term. Hours after the credits have rolled, a muted sense of sorrow still lingers.



Martin Scorsese took his inspiration from the late-life confessions of Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran, which detailed his past career as a hitman. Lawyer Charles Brandt recorded them in his 2004 book I Heard You Paint Houses. Frank (Robert De Niro) was a Philadelphia truck driver who fell under the influence of two prominent mafiosos, Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel). As the film implies, his time fighting in Italy in the Second World War had seen his moral compass replaced with an unwavering commitment to following orders. It made him an ideal choice to do the mob’s dirty work. Eventually, he ended up working for Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the head of America’s most powerful union, with deep ties to the nation’s criminal organisations.



Scorsese’s signature camerawork goes down like a glass of fine whisky, as smooth and as elegant as you’d expect. The violence arrives in short, sharp shocks. In that sense, it does feel like a throwback to the director’s golden age, especially with the reunion of two of his greatest collaborators, De Niro and Pesci. And though it may be the first time he’s worked with Pacino, the actor’s still a titan of the genre.



De Niro and Pacino haven’t exactly been chasing prestige projects recently, while Pesci has been largely retired for the past decade. But here, all three of them are recharged. These are stunning performances. De Niro delicately maps the death of Frank’s conscience. His shifts in mood are barely perceptible – above all, he’s the quiet, sturdy right-hand man – but you feel by the end that something profound has changed within him. Pacino, meanwhile, bristles with energy. But his delirious charisma finally feels grounded again, no longer edging into self-parody.



Pesci feels the most revelatory here, however. His entire career of playing vulgar, volatile men has been flipped on its head; Russell is at his most powerful when he doesn’t say a word. A knowing look can change the entire course of a man’s life. The Irishman’s women, too, communicate mostly through glances. They are the silent observers of this decay. They are the furies, watching and judging from afar. It’s a film that’s told from an entirely masculine viewpoint, but one that isn’t ignorant of where it intersects with a feminine one.



As much as The Irishman lives in the shadows of Scorsese’s past, it’s slower and more solemn than what’s come before. In one flashback, we see Frank force Italian soldiers to dig their own graves before he executes them. In a way, these gangsters carve the same fate for themselves. The Irishman reminds us, in a way starker than any of Scorsese’s previous work, that retribution is inevitable."
28,Ex_Machina_1.docx,"THE TURING TEST detects if a machine can truly think like a human. The Bechdel Test detects gender bias in fiction. If you were to mash the two together the overlap shall henceforth be known as the Ex Machina Zone.

In writer/director Alex Garland's thought-provoking new film we meet Ava, an artificially intelligent robot. Ava's creator, genius tech billionaire Nathan has asked his employee Caleb to determine whether Ava's thinking is indistinguishable from a human's. Until she meets Caleb, Ava has only ever met her maker and one other woman. Her existence, and her ability to learn how to interact, is a fascinating study of what makes us human.

It's also a compelling, if problematic, look at the interactions between men and women. 

While interviewing Garland, I asked him about the roles of men and women in his film; his response was that Ava is not a woman, she is genderless. Despite using female pronouns, the things that would define gender in a man and a woman, she lacks them, except in external terms. I'm not even sure consciousness itself has a gender.

In a way, Garland is right; pure intelligence wouldn't have a gender. But to say that and then place that consciousness into a body that it will immediately recognize its likeness as female negates that point. She's a seductress posing as a damsel in distress, using her wiles to get Caleb to save her from Nathan.

He believes his movie is a commentary on the ""constructs we've made around girls in their early 20s and the way we condition them culturally"". ""You're not supposed to warm to Nathan over that stuff.""

Yet, in the pursuit of that commentary, the movie ends up re-enacting those same patterns. Ava does prove to be the smartest creature on the screen, but the message we're left with at the end of Ex Machina is still that the best way for a miraculously intelligent creature to get what she wants is to flirt manipulatively. 

Ava's predicament really isn't that different from many female AIs who have come before her, from Metropolis' Maria to *Her'*s Samantha to *Blade Runner'*s Pris. 

This tendency to give female AIs the most basic and stereotypical feminine characteristics is, according to Kathleen Richardson, probably a reflection of ""what some men think about women that they're not fully human beings."" 



""Women, whatever their qualities intelligent, vulnerable, strong are always presented in an attractive form, as if the package is the only way to deliver these qualities. Male intelligence, strength, vulnerabilities can be delivered in a multiple and varied kind of outer packaging.”



Ava learns to use seduction as manipulation, it's more blatant when even a robot can pull it off.

The thing is, Alan Turing himself actually might have wanted AI to be something akin to what Caleb wants: actual companionship. 



Obviously, wanting affection is part of what makes us human; by showing that, Ava is showing a highly evolved part of herself. But by only showing her highly manipulative nature, she is left as a less-than-whole character. Like Her, Ex Machina is a smart, beautiful film. But when the only female lead in your movie is one whose function is to turn the male lead on while being in a position to be turned off, that says a lot about what you think of the value of women in films. Saying it's the result of your protagonist being ""creepy,"" as Garland does, doesn't really absolve you of that."
29,Avengers_2.docx,"Avengers: Endgame review – unconquerable brilliance takes Marvel to new heights

The previous Avengers movie, Infinity War, stunned believers and unbelievers alike with its sheer stupendous scale, and that devastating ending in which the evil Thanos appeared to have gained victory by getting hold of all six of the Infinity Stones, causing a crumbling-to-dust of many key players: a terrible cosmic loss, irreparable, irreversible, surely?

We were of course promised wild new surprises with this colossal climactic movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directed by the Russo brothers, Joe and Anthony. But would these surprises be .... new ways of coming to terms with the unchangeable disaster? Unexpected coping strategies? Novel means of simply accepting the Avengers’ stunningly permanent defeat?

In chess, an “endgame” sees relatively few pieces on the board – but of course, this film is much more heavily populated. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is floating, desolately, in space, staring extinction in the face. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) confronts the loss of his family – a rather eerie, challengingly downbeat opening scene. Steve Rogers, formerly Captain America (Chris Evans) is helping others deal with their awful sense of cosmic grief. Rhodey (Don Cheadle) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are grimly getting on things. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) is a vivid new presence in everyone’s lives.

And change is the keynote. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) has found a way to co-exist as a gentle human intellectual and a green monster. He is now half-man, half-hulk (mulk?) and is now reconciled to a new twilight of celebrity, accepting selfie opportunities with kids.

But Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a worry. The great catastrophe has caused him to retreat to New Asgard, where he has put on an enormous amount of weight and morosely obsessed with beer and video games. It is a very funny performance from Hemsworth, emphasising that he is first among equals with the Avengers when it comes to comedy. Other people get funny lines as well, and the words “Mungo Jerry” gets one of the biggest laughs of the film.

But part of this movie is about how Thor comes to terms with the memory of his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo), and also in fact how Tony Stark achieves closure on the subject of his dad, Howard (John Slattery). And there are many more characters and subordinate narrative arcs to absorb. The poster is not an infallible guide. It is, as ever, a huge intricately detailed and interlocking mosaic of figures within that strange Avengers universe, which uniquely (and bizarrely) combines both the mythic and the contemporary – and which is here the stage for a Tolkienian quest.

Avengers: Endgame is entirely preposterous and, yes, the central plot device here does not, in itself, deliver the shock of the new. But the sheer enjoyment and fun that it delivers, the pure exotic spectacle, are irresistible, as is its insouciant way of combining the serious and the comic. Without the comedy, the drama would not be palatable. Yet without the earnest, almost childlike belief in the seriousness of what is at stake, the funny stuff would not work either. As an artificial creation, the Avengers have been triumphant, and as entertainment, they have been unconquerable."
30,Minority_Report_3.docx,"At a time when movies think they have to choose between action and ideas, Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" is a triumph--a film that works on our minds and our emotions. It is a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit. Here is a master filmmaker at the top of his form, working with a star, Tom Cruise, who generates complex human feelings even while playing an action hero.

I complained earlier this summer of awkward joins between live action and CGI; I felt the action sequences in ""Spider-Man"" looked too cartoonish, and that ""Star Wars Episode II,"" by using computer effects to separate the human actors from the sets and CGI characters, felt disconnected and sterile. Now here is Spielberg using every trick in the book and matching them without seams, so that no matter how he's achieving his effects, the focus is always on the story and the characters.

The movie turns out to be eerily prescient, using the term ""pre-crime"" to describe stopping crimes before they happen; how could Spielberg have known the government would be using the same term this summer? In his film, inspired by but much expanded from a short story by Philip K. Dick, Tom Cruise is John Anderton, chief of the Department of Pre-Crime in the District of Columbia, where there has not been a murder in six years. Soon, it appears, there will be a murder--committed by Anderton himself.

The year is 2054. Futuristic skyscrapers coexist with the famous Washington monuments and houses from the 19th century. Anderton presides over an operation controlling three ""Pre-Cogs,"" precognitive humans who drift in a flotation tank, their brain waves tapped by computers. They're able to pick up thoughts of premeditated murders and warn the cops, who swoop down and arrest the would-be perpetrators before the killings can take place.

Because this is Washington, any government operation that is high-profile and successful inspires jealousy. Anderton's superior, bureau director Burgess (Max von Sydow) takes pride in him, and shields him from bureaucrats like Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), from the Justice Department. As the pre-crime strategy prepares to go national, Witwer seems to have doubts about its wisdom--or he is only jealous of its success? Spielberg establishes these characters in a dazzling future world, created by art director Alex McDowell, that is so filled with details large and small that we stop trying to figure out everything and surrender with a sigh. Some of the details: a computer interface that floats in mid-air, manipulated by Cruise with the gestures of a symphony conductor; advertisements that crawl up the sides of walls and address you personally; cars that whisk around town on magnetic cushions; robotic ""spiders"" that can search a building in minutes by performing a retinal scan on everyone in it. ""Blade Runner,"" also inspired by a Dick story, shows a future world in decay; ""Minority Report"" offers a more optimistic preview."
31,Big_Lebowski_1.docx,"""The Big Lebowski"" is about an attitude, not a story. It's easy to miss that, because the story is so urgently pursued. It involves kidnapping, ransom money, a porno king, a reclusive millionaire, a runaway girl, the Malibu police, a woman who paints while nude and strapped to an overhead harness, and the last act of the disagreement between Vietnam veterans and Flower Power. It has more scenes about bowling than anything else.



This is a plot and dialogue that perhaps only the Coen Brothers could have devised. I'm thinking less of their clarity in ""Fargo"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" than of the almost hallucinatory logic of ""Raising Arizona"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" Only a steady hand in the midst of madness allows them to hold it all together--that, and the delirious richness of their visual approach.



Anyone who cares about movies must surely have heard something about the plot. This is a movie that has inspired an annual convention and the Church of the Latter-Day Dude. Its star, Jeff Bridges, has become so identified with the starring role that when he won the 2010 Oscar for Best Actor, Twitterland mourned that his acceptance speech didn't begin with, ""The Dude Abides."" These words are so emblematic that they inspired a book title, The Dude Abides: The Gospel According to the Coen Brothers, by Cathleen Falsani. This is a serious book, though far from a dreary theological work.



The Dude is Jeff Lebowski, an unemployed layabout whose days are spent sipping White Russians and nights are spent at the bowling alley. There is always a little pot available. He has a leonine mane of chestnut hair, a shaggy goatee, and a wardrobe of Bermuda shorts, rummage sale shirts, bathrobes and flip-flop,. He went to Woodstock and never left. He lives in what may be the last crummy run-down low-rent structure in Malibu. Trust the Dude to find it.



It is widely known that the Dude was inspired by a real man named Jeff Dowd, a freelance publicist who was instrumental in launching ""Blood Simple"" (1984), the first film in the Coen canon. I have long known Jeff Dowd. I can easily see how he might have inspired the Dude. He is as tall, as shaggy and sometimes as mood-altered as Jeff Lebowski, although much more motivated. He remembers names better than a politician, is crafty in his strategies, and burns with a fiery zeal on behalf of those films he consents to represent.



In the film, Jeff Lebowski tells the millionaire's daughter (Julianne Moore) that in his youth he helped draft the Port Huron Statement that founded Students for a Democratic Society, and was a member of the Seattle Seven. In real life Jeff Dowd was indeed one of the Seattle Seven, and remains so militant that at Sundance 2009 he took a punch the jaw for insisting too fervently that a critic see ""Dirt,"" an ecological documentary Dowd believed was essential to the survival of the planet. True to his credo of nonviolence, the Dude did not punch back."

But, of course, this makes it highly sought after by all kinds of scary folks, so Frodo is in for more than his share of thrilling and terrifying adventures.

Somewhere, there are future Hollywood directors who will tell magazine feature writers that they first decided to make movies as they watched this film; it's that good. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a once-in-a-generation, not since Star Wars, transcendent reminder of why we tell stories, why we have imagination, and why we must go on quests to test our spirits and heal the world. And it's a story that invites us into a fully realized world with many different civilizations, all so thoroughly imagined that we don't only believe that they each have complete languages, but that they have dictionaries, histories, mythologies, schools, music, and poetry. Peter Jackson, who directed and co-wrote the script, has created a movie that seems astonishingly inventive and new and at the same time somehow seems as though it always existed inside us. Every detail, from the tiniest plant to the hugest battle, is exactly, satisfyingly right. The bad guys, all thundering hooves and billowing capes, seem to have come from the core of every nightmare since the world began. All three movies in the series were shot at once, so his singular vision can carry us through to the end.

A couple of caveats -- like Harry Potter, Frodo is a character who is more interesting on the page, where we can share his thoughts, than in a movie, where he is primarily called upon to look amazed, scared, or sad. And like Harry Potter, there were benefits to producing a series of films at the same time (continuity, commitment to getting all of the details right), but some drawbacks, too. So, we get glimpses of people who will be important later but now are somewhere between placeholders and distractions.

Families can talk about why only Frodo seems immune to the ring's power to corrupt even honorable, wise, and powerful people in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, as well as the notion that ""even the smallest person can change the course of the earth.""

If you were going to form a fellowship for a grand quest, who would you want to be in it?

How do you think the film adaptation compares with Tolkein's book?

How do the characters in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring demonstrate teamwork, perseverance, and courage? Why are these important character strengths?"
33,Cats_3.docx,"‘Cats’ Review: They Dance, They Sing, They Lick Their Digital Fur

It is tough to pinpoint when the kitschapalooza called “Cats” reaches its zenith or its nadir, which are one and the same. The choices are legion: Judi Dench gliding in as Old Deuteronomy, a Yoda-esque fluff ball with a huge ruff who brings to mind the Cowardly Lion en route to a drag ball as Queen Elizabeth I; the tap dancing Skimbleshanks (Steven McRae), dressed, unlike most of the furries — in red pants and suspenders, no less — leading a Pied Piper parade; or Taylor Swift, as Bombalurina, executing a joyless burlesque shimmy after descending on the scene astride a crescent moon that ejaculates iridescent catnip.

Certainly Hooper has made a robust effort, as suggested by all the busy leaping, pirouetting, stretching, caterwauling and meowing. To help make the transition to the screen he’s enlisted some talented performers to slink and sing, including Francesca Hayward, a principal dancer for the Royal Ballet making her movie debut as Victoria. The original musical involves a clowder of cats with its own lingo (“Jellicle”) that convenes on the night one is chosen to be reborn. This cat Christ element remains in the movie, which was written by Hooper and Lee Hall. But now the focus has shifted to Victoria, an abandoned kitty who sets off on a heroic journey amid swishing tails, bumping heads and hisses.



Transposing “Cats” to the screen was always going to be difficult, particularly once the decision was made to create a live-action version rather than an animated one. Traditional theater depends on the viewer’s going along with a very delicate balance of reality and unreality that comes when viewers breathe the same air and share the same space as live actors; movies create a different reality effect or, if you insist, magic. Part of the pleasure of theater (if you’re a partisan) is this human factor; but without the presence of hard-working troupers in fun fur in this “Cats,” all that’s left are canned images of fit-looking people meowing and raising their rumps high in the air.

 

The bobbing butts have their obvious appeal. But Hooper’s mistake is that he’s tried to class up the joint. What a blunder! In feline terms, this is a movie without epic hairballs, without rear-end sniffing, without a deep, wounding scratch. Instead the movie tamps down and tidies its innate strangeness, cutting carefully loose only in its more comic numbers. By far the best in show in this respect are James Corden, wittily frolicking amid trash as Bustopher Jones; and Rebel Wilson, whose spoiled Jennyanydots leads a Busby Berkeleyesque jaw-dropper with a warbling (quavering) company of mice and a parade of high-stepping, kaleidoscopically trained cockroaches.

Generally, Hooper pulls away from loony-tunes excess, tries for sexy rather than freaky, and plucks at heartstrings, a reflex that pulls the story into mawkishness, particularly when he cuts to Victoria. Hayward is a lovely, supple dancer, who brings some depth to her character purely through movement. Here, though, her face mostly conveys blurred yearning and all those close-ups suggest a director struggling to get more from an actor. It’s too bad that no one seems to have thought through the semiotics of Victoria’s chalky white cat face, given that Hayward is of mixed race and that the heavy is Idris Elba’s predatory Macavity. Elba seems to be having a fine time, but come on!"

Title: 19 Things The Matrix Predicted About Life in 2019

In an era when the president’s lawyer can go on TV and splutter, “Truth isn’t truth!” as if it’s something everyone should know, The Matrix is omnipresent. It’s not that the film was prescient. It didn’t anticipate our world. But it anticipated — and probably created — a new way of viewing that world. Since 1999, the real world has provided ample opportunity for people to turn The Matrix into the foundational text of a frighteningly thorough and self-adoring denial of whatever was in front of their noses, which roughly translates as, Reality is fake and I don’t have to listen to anyone about anything (plus maybe I know karate despite never having studied it). The Matrix concocted the perfect one-size-fits-all combination of flattery, paranoia, anti-corporate wokeness, libertarian belief in the primacy of the individual, and ideologically nonspecific anger at the system: a “Wake up, sheeple!” for its era and, even more, for ours. We live, today, in the anti-reality world The Matrix built.



In his 2001 paper “Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?,” Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom — who, funny enough, had not yet seen The Matrix when he wrote it — posited that if humanity does become capable of creating a Matrix-like simulation of reality, it will create many of them — meaning there would be lots of simulated realities and only one non-simulated one, in which case maybe it’s more likely than not that we’re living in a simulation right now.



Is Elon Musk the real-life Neo? A former Tesla exec says he’s the One: “Watch The Matrix. Elon is Neo. He sees these zeroes and ones.” Musk himself says there’s only a “one in billions chance” that we aren’t living in a simulation, and he may have hired scientists to try to break us out. But he also owns a company called Neuralink that seeks to connect human brains to computers, which is a little Agent Smith–y.



Kanye has called The Matrix “the Bible of the post-information age” and said, “When the hundred guys come at Neo, those are opinions, that’s perception, that’s tradition … If you have a focus wide and master senseis like Laurence Fishburne and you have a squad behind you, you literally can put the world in slow motion.” Also, he claims to be writing a philosophy book called Break the Simulation, he got the Kardashians to wear tiny sunglasses, and the sweatshirts and bomber jackets from his Yeezy Season 1 fashion line looked like dead stock from the store rooms of the Nebuchadnezzar.



Alex Jones, who says reality “is already an A.I. system that made the decision to have a post-human world, and Trump has jumped in with some others and they’re saying, ‘No, we’re not doing it,’ at the elite level.”"
35,Interstellar_3.docx,"Interstellar review



Interstellar takes place in a near future that harkens back to the recent past — like the 1950s Midwest or maybe the Dust Bowl, but with laptops and drones. There’s very little exposition; through telling details and offhand comments, you get the sense that there’s been an environmental disaster followed by a famine, and that humanity has scaled back its ambitions to bare subsistence. People farm corn — the one crop left unravaged by blight — watch baseball games in half-empty stands, and flee towering haboob dust storms announced by air raid sirens.



Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a NASA pilot who has turned to farming — like everyone else at the time, an odd cut to faux-documentary footage informs us. He lives in a ramshackle house, complaining to his father (John Lithgow) about humanity’s diminished horizons and doting on his daughter Murph, played by Mackenzie Foy with a believably teenage mix of mischief and exasperation.



McConaughey eventually leaves Foy and Earth behind to scout out a new home for for the human race, but it’s their relationship that grounds the movie. As action-filled as Nolan’s films are, they can sometimes feel abstract, like symbolic sublimations of some offscreen mental trauma. 



Interstellar features some of the most beautiful images of space I’ve seen on film. Space feels vast, with the spinning white vessel often relegated to a corner of the screen or lost against the rings of Saturn. The depiction of a wormhole accomplishes the seemingly impossible and makes, well, nothingness look dazzling, as light slides and warps around it like water off a bubble of oil. The black hole is even more amazing. Present throughout the movie, it’s in these lingering shots of a tiny spacecraft floating through the galaxy that the influence of Kubrick’s Space Odyssey is most clearly felt.



Not that it’s all languorous drifting through the galaxy. Nolan has a genius for landscape-scale action sequences, and the planets, with their alien weather and gravity, give him ample opportunity to stage them. The camera races and plunges and, especially in IMAX, creates classic theme-park pit-of-your-stomach thrills. There are gigantic waves, frozen clouds, and other dangers that feel threatening despite looking totally surreal.



The biggest danger the shuttle crew faces, however, is time. Time isn't just running out — it's compressing and stretching as they travel through space. The Nolans use relativity to create some original and urgent crises as the shuttle crew figures out how to best spend their shifting time. Time is a resource, like food or water, Hathaway warns. The time differential between the crew and those they left behind also gives rise to the movie’s most melancholy scenes. In this respect it feels less like Space Odyssey and more like Homer’s Odyssey, with McConaughey getting detained and delayed as time passes and things go wrong back home.



There’s always the question with Nolan of what it all means. His movies tempt you to demand a thesis, partly because his characters always seem to be grasping for one. They talk almost aphoristically about the human condition, ghosts, time, evil, love, and other heavy but abstract things, and they quote Dylan Thomas a few too many times. Ultimately I took the grander bits of dialogue as thematic signposts, telling you to keep your head at the level of death and humanity and time but not meaning much in themselves.



Which is fine. The movie is most powerful when it’s at its least abstract — when it’s working through the messy decisions and sacrifices that actual interstellar travel would entail, finding dramatic potential in the laws of physics. Interstellar is sometimes confusing, melodramatic, and self-serious, but Nolan managed to make a space epic on a human scale."
36,Big_Short_2.docx,"It sounds like a horror show: a doomsday epic about the 2008 financial crisis and the Wall Street wolves who got rich off it. Gone were the homes, jobs and savings of average Joes. But wait. As directed and written by Adam McKay – the dude behind Anchorman and other giddy hits with Will Ferrell, his partner on the website Funny or Die – The Big Short is hunting bigger game. I’d call it a Restoration comedy for right the fuck now, a farce fueled by rage against the machine that relentlessly kills ethics, and a hell of a hilarious time at the movies if you’re up for laughs that stick in your throat.

Based on the nonfiction bestseller by Michael Lewis, The Big Short is brilliantly constructed by McKay to hit where it hurts. A terrific Christian Bale pulls you right in as Michael Burry, an eccentric neurologist-turned-money-manager who pads around barefoot in his San Jose office, fiddling with his glass eye and banging drums. It’s Burry who figures out that those subprime home loans the banks hand out to bad credit risks are a disaster in the making.



Wall Street fat cats dismiss Burry as a crank. But not Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), a Deutsche Bank dealmaker who relishes Burry’s idea to bet against the banks by shorting home loans that are bound to default. Gosling, a virtuoso of verbal sleaze, talks directly to the camera, and he’s volcanically fierce and funny. It’s Vennett who intensifies the big short by partnering with Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a hedge-fund manager who runs FrontPoint, a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. Baum is a hardass. But he knows a good deal when it gets a thumbs-up from his trio of number crunchers (Rafe Spall, Hamish Linklater and Jeremy Strong). Baum is also the only character in the film with a working conscience. Carell is just tremendous, following his Oscar-nominated turn in Foxcatcher with a performance of comic cunning and shocking gravity. Likewise, Brad Pitt finds the disgust in Ben Rickert, a banker who’s paying for his sins by helping the environment – that is, until he uses two young money managers (Finn Wittrock and John Magaro) to bite the hand that fed him.



Camera maestro Barry Ackroyd helps McKay keep the plot in a perpetual spin. When it sails over your head – and it will – McKay drops in celeb explainers, including Selena Gomez, Anthony Bourdain and Margot Robbie. Are you more likely to understand CDOs if a naked Robbie explains them in a bubble bath? Probably not. But who’s complaining? McKay dares greatly by couching his anger in a slapstick tragedy that makes us wish we could see every character in it behind bars. Does the risk pay off? Bet on it."
37,Inception_2.docx,"The story can either be told in a few sentences, or not told at all. The movie is all about process, about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. 

Like the hero of that film, the viewer of ""Inception"" is adrift in time and experience. We can never even be quite sure what the relationship between dream time and real time is. The hero explains that you can never remember the beginning of a dream, and that dreams that seem to cover hours may only last a short time. Yes, but you don't know that when you're dreaming. And what if you're inside another man's dream? How does your dream time synch with his? What do you really know?

Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a corporate raider of the highest order. He infiltrates the minds of other men to steal their ideas. Now he is hired by a powerful billionaire to do the opposite: To introduce an idea into a rival's mind, and do it so well he believes it is his own. This has never been done before; our minds are as alert to foreign ideas as our immune system is to pathogens. The rich man, named Saito (Ken Watanabe), makes him an offer he can't refuse, an offer that would end Cobb's forced exile from home and family.

Dreams have a shifting architecture, as we all know; where we seem to be has a way of shifting. Cobb's assignment is the ""inception"" (or birth, or wellspring) of a new idea in the mind of another young billionaire, Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), heir to his father's empire. Saito wants him to initiate ideas that will lead to the surrender of his rival's corporation. Cobb needs Ariadne to create a deceptive maze-space in Fischer's dreams so that (I think) new thoughts can slip in unperceived. Cobb tutors Ariadne on the world of dream infiltration, the art of controlling dreams and navigating them. Nolan uses this as a device for tutoring us as well. 

If you've seen any advertising at all for the film, you know that its architecture has a way of disregarding gravity. Buildings tilt. Streets coil. Characters float. This is all explained in the narrative. The movie is a perplexing labyrinth without a simple through-line, and is sure to inspire truly endless analysis on the web.

Nolan helps us with an emotional thread. The reason Cobb is motivated to risk the dangers of inception is because of grief and guilt involving his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), and their two children. Cotillard beautifully embodies the wife in an idealized way. Whether we are seeing Cobb's memories or his dreams is difficult to say--even, literally, in the last shot. But she makes Mal function as an emotional magnet, and the love between the two provides an emotional constant in Cobb's world, which is otherwise ceaselessly shifting.

""Inception"" works for the viewer, in a way, like the world itself worked for Leonard, the hero of ""Memento."" We are always in the Now. We have made some notes while getting Here, but we are not quite sure where Here is. Yet matters of life, death and the heart are involved--oh, and those multi-national corporations, of course."
38,Inception_3.docx,"Freud believed that dreams were compounded out of the primal matter of the unconscious and the prosaic events of daily life. If he were writing now, he would have to acknowledge that they are also, for many of us, made out of movies.

So “Inception” is not necessarily the kind of experience you would take to your next shrink appointment. It is more like a diverting reverie than a primal nightmare, something to be mused over rather than analyzed, something you may forget as soon as it’s over. 

Using a combination of drugs, wires and other vaguely Matrix-y methods, Cobb and his co-workers penetrate the minds of their slumbering targets, usually for the purpose of extracting hidden information. But a wealthy client named Saito (Ken Watanabe) induces them to try the much more difficult trick known as inception, which involves planting an idea someone else’s mind that will bear fruit in the real world.

In any case, Cobb and his team are trying to induce a young man (Cillian Murphy), whose father (Pete Postlethwaite) is a business rival of Saito’s, to break up the company he is about to inherit. This bit of commercial intrigue provides the fairly banal material foundation on which Mr. Nolan’s phantasmagorical world is built. 

Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are a pair of wisecracking specialists in something-or-another, and Ellen Page is the architect. This means that she designs the physical environments in which the dreams take place, and also that, like a precocious sophomore in a graduate seminar, asks the right questions and spells out the obvious connections.

She also notices that Cobb’s personal issues are clouding his ability to work and putting the rest of them at a vaguely defined but serious risk — a graver danger than just waking up. (The conceit that they’re all dreaming takes some of the edge off the movie’s violence, since it’s hard to grieve for extras who are just “projections” in some else’s mental theater. On the other hand, that is pretty much what all movie characters are. This is what I meant by overdetermined.)

But though there is a lot to see in “Inception,” there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan’s idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness — the risk of real confusion, of delirium, of ineffable ambiguity — that this subject requires. The unconscious, as Freud (and Hitchcock, and a lot of other great filmmakers) knew, is a supremely unruly place, a maze of inadmissible desires, scrambled secrets, jokes and fears. If Mr. Nolan can’t quite reach this place, that may be because his access is blocked by the very medium he deploys with such skill.

And the limitations of “Inception” may suggest the limits not only of this very talented director, but also of his chosen art form at this moment in its history. Our dreams feed the movies. The movies feed our dreams. But somehow, our imaginations are still hungry."
39,Big_Short_3.docx,"One of the strangest elements of Anchorman director Adam McKay’s goofy 2010 comedy The Other Guys was the inclusion of some credit sequence infographics about corporate fraud and capitalist corruption that seemed to have been crowbarred in from another movie. It now transpires that McKay, a Saturday Night Live graduate who is no stranger to political satire, viewed The Other Guys as a slapstick allegory for the recent financial crisis and was working on the movie when he first read Michael Lewis’s nonfiction book The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, an account of the people who predicted (and profited from) the crash of 2007-8.

Rewriting a Charles Randolph script already commissioned by Brad Pitt’s company, Plan B (Pitt has a cameo as the film’s quasi-counterculture conscience), McKay turns Lewis’s dense source into a blackly catastrophic comedy, a story of greed, venality, incompetence and barefaced corruption in which the good guys are the renegades who see disaster coming and stake their shirts on the apocalypse. Unlike the slick suits and killer sheen of Oliver Stone’s Wall Street, this is a world of chaos and disorder filled with misfits who understand numbers more than people; from Christian Bale’s Michael Burry, a socially awkward heavy-metal enthusiast who dreams up the credit default swaps that enable him to “short” the housing market, to Steve Carell’s bereaved and fractured Mark Baum (a character inspired by the real-life Steve Eisman) who balances moral outrage and repressed self-loathing as he swims with sharks in the cesspool of the financial market.

Some of the finance-speak terminology is hard to follow (few civilians have heard of a collateralised debt obligation and The Big Short makes it clear that even the pros don’t really know what goes into one) so McKay cooks up some kooky celebrity cameos – Selena Gomez at the gambling tables; Margot Robbie in a bubble bath – to explain the plot at key moments, a device that isn’t as amusingly educative as the film-makers imagine.

No matter. The rest of the unfolding tragicomic drama is utterly engrossing, blending the insight of JC Chandor’s 2011 gem Margin Call with the satirical bite of Po Bronson’s prophetic 1995 novel, Bombardiers. By coincidence, The Big Short opens in UK cinemas just as Ramin Bahrani’s 99 Homes, a powerful account of the human cost of the housing crash, comes to DVD. Together, the two films make a riveting (and horrifying) double bill."
40,Interstellar_2.docx,"Off to the Stars, With Grief, Dread and Regret



Like the great space epics of the past, Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” distills terrestrial anxieties and aspirations into a potent pop parable, a mirror of the mood down here on Earth.  “Interstellar,” full of visual dazzle, thematic ambition, geek bait and corn (including the literal kind), is a sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret.



What our planet and species need saving from is a slow-motion environmental catastrophe. We are in a rural stretch of North America, a land of battered pickup trucks, dusty bluejeans and wind-burned farmers scanning the horizon for signs of a storm. 



The head of the family in question is Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a widower who lives with his two children and his father-in-law (John Lithgow). Once a NASA pilot, Cooper now grows corn, the only thing that will grow after a blight has wiped out most of the planet’s other crops. The human population has shrunk to a desperate remnant, but the survivors cling to the habits and rituals of normal life. The blight is spreading, the dust storms are growing worse, and the sense of an ending is palpable.



The Nolans cleverly conflate scientific denialism with technophobia, imagining a fatalistic society that has traded large ambition for small-scale problem solving and ultimate resignation. As it celebrates the resistance to extinction — taking as its touchstone Dylan Thomas’s famous villanelle “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,” with its repeated invocation of “rage against the dying of the light” — “Interstellar” becomes an allegory of its own aspirations, an argument for grandeur, scale and risk, on screen and off.



The Nolans are fond of doubled characters and mirrored plots, and so “Interstellar” is built around twinned father-daughter stories. Among Cooper’s colleagues on board the spaceship is Dr. Brand (Anne Hathaway), whose father, also called Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), has developed the theories behind their quest. He and Murph remain on the ground, crunching the numbers and growing older in the usual earthly way, while Cooper and the younger Brand, thanks to relativity, stay pretty much the same age.  The two pairs of daughters and dads perform variations on the theme of paternal and filial love, finding delicate and moving passages of loyalty, rebellion, disillusionment and acceptance.



Of course, the film is more than that. It is in the nature of science fiction to aspire to more, to ascend fearlessly toward the sublime. You could think of “Interstellar,” which has a lot to say about gravity, as the anti-""Gravity.” That movie, which would fit inside this one twice, stripped away the usual sci-fi metaphysics, presenting space travel as an occasion for quiet wonder and noisy crisis management. Mr. Nolan takes the universe and eternity itself as his subject and his canvas, brilliantly exploiting cinema’s ability to shift backward and sideways in time (through flashbacks and cross cuts), even as it moves relentlessly forward.



But “Gravity” and “Interstellar” are both ultimately about the longing for home, about voyages into the unknown that become odysseys of return. And “Interstellar” may take its place in the pantheon of space movies because it answers an acute earthly need, a desire not only for adventure and novelty but also, in the end, for comfort."
41,War_Games_1.docx,"War Games: The Dead Code Is a direct-to-DVD sequel to the cult film about a hacked governmental computer and a near nuclear apocalypse. This time around, expert gamer and computer whiz Will Farmer stumbles upon the ultimate online frag-fest, ""The Dead Code"", a video game in which players rack up points by annihilating American civilians. Little does Will know that the game is actually part of an NSA A.I. designed to weed out potential terrorists. The film is directed by Stuart Gillard and the screenplay is written by Randall Badat. While I'm not sure I'd call this movie one of the worst of all times, I'd place it on the level of another really bad sequel - Lawnmower Man 2. Both dealt with hackers and played fast and loose with what scientific accuracy or plausibility on any scale and both are quite atrocious. I know, I know. That's an odd comparison, but honestly, what else could this movie be compared to? It's watchable, sure, but you'll find yourself laughing through most of the supposedly tense scenes, and the scenes that aren't tense/laughable? You'll be bored to tears. Matt Lanter plays Will Farmer and sad to say, the guy has talent. He's still learning for sure, but he seems comfortable enough in front of the camera, and even manages to keep from cracking up while he struggles through the terribly lame dialogue, but this film may very well kill his up-and-coming career while still in the womb. All of the other actors are disposable, and you'll find similar performances in your school play. The premise of the film is the government's ""R.I.P.LE.Y."" program (an acronym for something I don't care to recall) and how Will gets flagged for his gaming skills combined with his accidental usage of terror-funded money to play. While there are true ways in which potential terror threats are flagged in real life, it's completely unfeasible that someone's ability to fly a CG missile through a video game would make everyone on capital hill immediately lock in on him. What's worse is that apparently all the terrorists are doing it, as evidenced by the opening scene of several young and sexy teenagers being nuked because the R.I.P.L.E.Y. system flagged them from playing ""The Dead Code"". The idea that people planning to commit acts of terror would all flock to the newest and hippest online game to hone their evil skills is a leap of faith too far for an intelligent viewer to make. ""Well aren't they flagging the people because of the terror-money they're using to play?"" you ask? If that's so, then whats the point of analyzing their scores and watching their progress in the game?! On top of all that, apparently Uncle Sam likes to telegraph that it's coming to get you by sending creepy messages to your phone and constantly restarting the game. What serious terrorist would sit idly by and assume it was all a trick? And another thing, how come apparently everyone at Will's school is a computer genius? Not every average high school girl can plant hacker-traps on their facebook. Apparently it's commonplace though, as Will's dumbass best friend thinks its all quite elementary. I better stop now. I admit that I've lingered too long on the general conceit of the film and not so much the film itself, but that's enough. The movie does not work. Period. Whatever charm the original film had is shamed by this low-budget cash-in."

Title: Artificial Intelligence: What Is The Matrix?

Horror or paradise?  That was the question.

For those who see the trajectory of our modern global supply chain and the separate, but intertwined vector coming clear in the world of pure information this dystopic future is starting to look possible. The threat comes from Artificial Intelligence, meaning machines that learn.

Information technology is rapidly merging with operational technology (OT) as software originally intended to ease reporting and decision making for supply chain managers starts to connect directly to property, plant and equipment.  Cool ideas about the Industrial Internet of Things promise new profit streams from capital equipment and better environmental performance for existing infrastructure.

Faster still is the consumer-driven marriage of IT and OT that is happening on Apple , Microsoft and Android devices all around the world.  Integration is easy – usually just a download away – and the heaviest users who are all young have initiated an explosion of demand data that consumer goods makers and retailers crave.

Whether the focus is demand or supply, and in terms of better sensing, decision making or responding digitization is changing the supply chain management discipline.  In the near term most executives are facing technology investment decisions ranging from advanced robotics in plants and DC’s to big data projects bolted on to forecasting systems.  In the longer term however, the cumulative impact and value of such investments absolutely depends on having a compelling vision of what the digitized supply chain is.

The grim end game of the Matrix embodies everything we dread most about artificial intelligence.  Humans, sated physically and lazy enough intellectually to accept the rules of our collective virtual world, cease to create.  Stripped of the need to meet a challenge we abdicate our duty to learn.  The game becomes static and we lose, perpetually.

Our path to the technology enabled end-to-end digital supply chain must avoid over reliance on automation, and in particular, selectively make bets on artificial intelligence.  However effectively algorithms might handle order commitments or production planning human judgement cannot be left out of the process.  Executives and practitioners who understand the optimization algorithms they use can learn by doing and rise with the tide of a faster, smarter supply chain.  Everyone else will be out of a job.

Automation will permeate all corners of demand sense and respond as well as supply visibility and execution.  Its limit however, can and should be the humble, but vital decision making realm of S&OP.

Digitization will inevitably deliver more precise and timely information to S&OP.  Winners will be those who can use it to make more money for the business.  Leaders will be those who know what additional information is worth investing in to make still better decisions the next time.

We are building the Matrix right now.  It is essential that we stay on top of what it can do for us."
43,Irishman_1.docx,"Martin Scorsese’s return to organized crime takes place over roughly 50 years in the life of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a real-life hitman whose exploits powered Charles Brandt’s non-fiction book I Heard You Paint Houses.



The Irishman introduces Frank as a delivery-truck driver who engages in meat theft and gets away with it. He soon falls in with the Bufalino crime family, becoming close with Russell (Joe Pesci) and later influential union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Frank shoots plenty of people in the head, but he spends just as much time smoothing over little beefs, parsing the hidden meanings of a mobster confiding that he’s “a little concerned” about another mobster’s failure to fall in line.



The retro clunkiness of these characters, well past their physical primes, is key to what makes The Irishman often surprisingly hilarious. The tough guys — especially Pacino’s volatile Hoffa — bicker over punctuality, offer each other cereal, drink ginger ale. De Niro and Pacino share a hotel room wearing grandpa pajamas.



Pacino is delightful in his role, reconciling his preening showboating with his ability to go quiet and seething. Pesci, meanwhile, inverts his violent-hothead characters from Goodfellas and Casino. He’s the even-keeled higher-up who evaluates the situation and issues his orders, still calling De Niro “kid” after decades together. It’s an impressive, imposing bit of restraint.



The De Niro performance will probably strike some Scorsese habitués as boilerplate. But as The Irishman goes on and on, wonderfully entertaining but not concise, his work gathers power. The movie barely covers the growth of Frank’s family. It’s no accident that Frank’s closest relationships are with fellow gangsters. He may not revel in violence, but he’s at home in that world, more so than in the domestic sphere.



All of Scorsese’s violent movies reckon with the consequences of their violence, but The Irishman is particularly interesting in the way it follows Frank as he ages. Frank lives with what he does yet seems fully unequipped to grapple with it. The movie is chilling not because De Niro plays Frank as an icy, remorseless killer, but because he’s an affable company man, proud of his union appreciation dinner, and he also happens to kill without remorse.



Scorsese has often regarded his gangster characters with a mixture of fascination and repulsion, and they’ve never looked less glamorous than they do here. The major players of The Irishman weave in and out of ’60s and ’70s American history. Yet most of them, particularly Frank, seem to be living for their pointless, petty work, fighting a losing battle against the clock. In many ways, this is an Old Man movie — a slower late-period work by a filmmaker ruminating on his advancing age, and on the beloved classics he made as a younger guy. But it’s Scorsese’s version: pulsing with more life than most younger filmmakers, before giving way to stark, chilling regret."
44,Cats_2.docx,"Cats Review – Will Haunt Viewers for Generations

When asked at the world premiere of Cats on Monday if he was happy with how the film looked, director Tom Hooper replied wearily that he had finished it “at 8am the previous day”. Yet one wonders if more time spent perfecting the state-of-the-art digital fur technology in his baffling adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s smash-hit stage musical would have helped.

The original musical, based on TS Eliot’s 1939 poetry collection Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, is widely acknowledged as a plotless spectacle. That Hooper, who made 2012’s Oscar-winning Les Misérables, felt the story would lend itself to a feature film was optimistic at best. In a neon-lit junkyard somewhere in London’s West End, abandoned white kitten Victoria (the Royal Ballet’s Francesca Hayward) finds herself among a community of “jellicle cats” competing for the chance to ascend to the heaviside layer, aka cat heaven, where they will be reborn. Each cat must prove themselves by singing a song: one lucky winner is chosen by Judi Dench’s gender-flipped Old Deuteronomy (who has fur, but also, illogically, wears a fur coat). Much like season three of American Idol, there are tears, VIP guests and a thankless performance from the otherwise talented Jennifer Hudson.

With no narrative scaffolding in place, the film relies on Lloyd Webber and Trevor Nunn’s songs. Styled in a Prince-style purple coat, pop star Jason Derulo brings some sexual energy to Rum Tum Tugger. Taylor Swift’s bratty, libidinous Bombalurina is better – stomping around in high heels, shimmying her furry breasts and purring “Macavity the mystery cat” with a faux-British accent. Swift is the only cast member who seems to be having fun, perhaps because she only appears in the film for approximately 10 minutes.

For most of the others involved, it’s a clear career low. Rebel Wilson’s number involves a conga line of dancing cockroaches, while James Corden’s overweight tabby, Bustopher Jones, rolls around in an actual pile of litter. One wonders if the actors are aware of what they’ve gotten themselves into. There’s something undignified about watching Ian McKellen (who plays Gus the Theatre Cat) meowing and lapping a bowl of milk in his bare feet; Jennifer Hudson’s Grizabella is ugly-crying in every one of her scenes; and when Rum Tum Tugger grimaces direct to camera, it feels like Derulo is breaking the fourth wall.

The camera’s canted angles and shaky closeups convulse with feeling that the actors can’t seem to summon. Ensemble dance sequences convey neither emotion nor information (except that the felines each have 10 fully articulated human toes). The film is rated U, but many of its uncanny images are sure to haunt viewers for generations.Everything feels off, from the scale of the purpose-built set (which makes the cats look more like Borrowers) to the erratic interpretations of its musical numbers. Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, in which mischievous cats trash a human house, is joyless and devoid of anarchy. Hudson’s 11th-hour ballad, Memory, feels like a desperate, last-ditch grasp towards something resembling pathos.

Regarding cats or humans, Hooper, it seems, has nothing to say. This is middlebrow film-making at its most hubristic; too inelegant to coast on spectacle alone, it’s not subversive enough to be considered truly camp either. I expect the film’s grab-bag celebrity cast and Christmas release date will secure its box-office success. The stage is on fire, but the show must go on."
45,Minority_Report_2.docx,"The launch of Microsoft's new Kinect games system, which allows players to run, jump, punch and shoot without having to wear strange clothing or hold any kind of controller, has got technology and cinema buffs alike thinking of Tom Cruise again. Specifically, the moment in the film Minority Report when Cruise, playing police chief John Anderton, tries to figure out film footage and computer data by waving his hands around in mid-air to manipulate it: turning it, shrinking it, pushing it aside, revolving it. Give it time: in a few years, we'll more than likely be controlling our computers in a similar way.

When Minority Report came out in the summer of 2002 – the iPod was less than a year old and the iPhone and iPad weren't even gleams in Steve Jobs's glinting eyes – its technological visions of the future seemed mind-bogglingly cool. The film was set in 2054 (Philip K Dick's short story, on which it is based, isn't so specific), so director Steven Spielberg presumably reckoned he was giving it plenty of room for the array of cutting-edge technologies to become part of our daily life.

What Spielberg didn't count on, though, is what might be called ""the Star Trek effect"". If you show off imaginary cool technology in a film or TV series, then kids, teenagers and enthusiastic technologists of all ages will try their damnedest to make it come true. When James T Kirk beamed down to an alien planet and flipped open his communicator, when Spock waved his tricorder over strange life forms and murmured ""intriguing . . ."", when the crew of the Enterprise teleported, carried phasers, communicated with their computer by voice and carried data around on little plastic sticks, a generation looked at it and thought: that's a future I want to live in.

And so with Minority Report. In the manner of all the best science-fiction, it included numerous gadgets but didn't rely on any of them as the key to its plot, which still revolved (as was Dick's predilection) on people's ability to deceive themselves about truth, lies and reality.

For a lot of geeky fans, however, the plot was incidental to the possibilities offered by the technologies on show. And there were plenty: pre-crime (predicting that a particular person will commit a crime); iris recognition (picking you out from a crowd on the basis of the unique pattern of your iris); personalised advertising (where what you see on hoardings is targeted specifically to you); e-paper (electronic paper, for newspapers with moving images that people can read on trains); 3D video (do we have to explain this?); computer-guided cars (which follow preset patterns); spider robots (for tracking people); jetpacks; and some rather unpleasant police restraint technologies – including the sick stick (makes you sick on contact) and ""the collar"" (which effectively paralyses you once fitted).

Things such as gesture computing were still way off (though a jetpack had been used in the opening ceremony of the 1984 Olympic Games). But, eight years on, Spielberg and his technical advisers look as though they were too cautious . . ."
46,Dark_Knight_1.docx,"The Dark Knight, director Christopher Nolan’s absolute stunner of a follow-up to 2005’s Batman Begins, is a potent provocation decked out as a comic-book movie. Feverish action? Check. Dazzling spectacle? Check. Devilish fun? Check. But Nolan is just warming up. There’s something raw and elemental at work in this artfully imagined universe. Striking out from his Batman origin story, Nolan cuts through to a deeper dimension. Huh? Wha? How can a conflicted guy in a bat suit and a villain with a cracked, painted-on clown smile speak to the essentials of the human condition? Just hang on for a shock to the system. The Dark Knight creates a place where good and evil — expected to do battle — decide instead to get it on and dance. “I don’t want to kill you,” Heath Ledger’s psycho Joker tells Christian Bale’s stalwart Batman. “You complete me.” Don’t buy the tease. He means it.

The trouble is that Batman, a.k.a. playboy Bruce Wayne, has had it up to here with being the white knight. He’s pissed that the public sees him as a vigilante. He’ll leave the hero stuff to district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and stop the DA from moving in on Rachel Dawes (feisty Maggie Gyllenhaal, in for sweetie Katie Holmes), the lady love who is Batman’s only hope for a normal life.

Everything gleams like sin in Gotham City (cinematographer Wally Pfister shot on location in Chicago, bringing a gritty reality to a cartoon fantasy). And the bad guys seem jazzed by their evildoing. Take the Joker, who treats a stunningly staged bank robbery like his private video game with accomplices in Joker masks, blood spurting and only one winner. Nolan shot this sequence, and three others, for the IMAX screen and with a finesse for choreographing action that rivals Michael Mann’s Heat. But it’s what’s going on inside the Bathead that pulls us in. Bale is electrifying as a fallibly human crusader at war with his own conscience.

I can only speak superlatives of Ledger, who is mad-crazy-blazing brilliant as the Joker. Miles from Jack Nicholson’s broadly funny take on the role in Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman, Ledger takes the role to the shadows, where even what’s comic is hardly a relief. No plastic mask for Ledger; his face is caked with moldy makeup that highlights the red scar of a grin, the grungy hair and the yellowing teeth of a hound fresh out of hell. To the clown prince of crime, a knife is preferable to a gun, the better to “savor the moment.”

The deft script, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, taking note of Bob Kane’s original Batman and Frank Miller’s bleak rethink, refuses to explain the Joker with pop psychology. Forget Freudian hints about a dad who carved a smile into his son’s face with a razor. As the Joker says, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stranger.”

The Joker represents the last completed role for Ledger, who died in January at 28 before finishing work on Terry Gilliam’s The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus."
47,Blade_Runner_2.docx,"It’s entirely apt that a film dedicated to replication should exist in multiple versions; there is not one Blade Runner, but seven. Though opinions on which is best vary and every edition has its partisans, the definitive rendering of Ridley Scott’s 1982 dystopian film is most likely The Final Cut (2002), about to play out once more in cinemas across the UK. Aptly, too, repetition is written into the movie’s plot (there are spoilers coming), that sees Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) as an official bounty hunter (or “Blade Runner”) consigned to hunt down, one after the other, four Nexus-6 replicants (genetically-designed artificial human beings, intended as slaves for Earth’s off-world colonies). One by one, our equivocal hero seeks out the runaways: worldly-wise Zhora (Joanna Cassidy); stolid Leon (Brion James); the “pleasure-model” Pris (Daryl Hannah); and the group’s apparent leader, the ultimate Nietzschean blond beast, Roy Batty (the wonderful Rutger Hauer). Along the way, Deckard meets and falls in love with another replicant, Rachael (Sean Young), as beautiful and cold as a porcelain doll.

In Blade Runner, as in all science-fiction, the “future” is a style. Here that style is part film noir and part Gary Numan. The 40s influence is everywhere: in Rachael’s Joan-Crawford shoulder pads, the striped shadows cast by Venetian blinds, the atmosphere of defeat. It’s not just noir, Ridley Scott also taps into 70s cop shows and movies that themselves tapped into nostalgic style, with their yearning jazz and their sad apartments; Deckard even visits a strip joint as all TV detectives must. The movie remains one of the most visually stunning in cinema history. It plots a planet of perpetual night, a landscape of shadows, rain and reflected neon (shone on windows or the eye) in a world not built to a human scale; there, the skyscrapers dwarf us like the pyramids. High above the Philip Marlowe world, hover cars swoop and dirigible billboards float by. More dated now than its hard-boiled lustre is the movie’s equal and opposite involvement in modish early 80s dreams; the soundtrack by Vangelis was up-to-the-minute, while the replicants dress like extras in a Billy Idol video, a post-punk, synth-pop costume party. However, it is noir romanticism that wins out, gifting the film with its forlorn Californian loneliness.

t is a starkly empty film, preoccupied as it is with the thought that people themselves might be hollow. The plot depends on the notion that the replicants must be allowed to live no longer than four years, because as time passes they begin to develop raw emotions. Why emotion should be a capital offence is never sufficiently explained; but it is of a piece with the film’s investigation of a flight from feeling – what psychologist Ian D Suttie once named the “taboo on tenderness”. Intimacy here is frightful (everyone appears to live alone), especially that closeness that suggests that the replicants might be indistinguishable from us.

This anxiety may originally have had tacit political resonances. In the novel that the film is based on, Philip K Dick’s thoughtful Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968), the dilemma of the foot soldier plays out, commanded to kill an adversary considered less human than ourselves, yet troubled by the possibility that the enemy are in fact no different. Shades of Vietnam darken the story, as well as memories of America’s slave-owning past. We are told that the replicants can do everything a human being can do, except feel empathy. Yet how much empathy do we feel for faraway victims or inconvenient others?"
48,Blank_Check_3.docx,"‘Blank Check’



It's fitting that Brian Bonsall has the lead in ""Blank Check."" After all, he was Michael J. Fox's little brother in ""Family Ties,"" and the role of Preston Waters here is nothing more than a junior edition of Alex Keaton. Fox himself is now too old for the part, but while Bonsall is shorter in size, he's a virtual Xerox of Foxian mannerisms, with some Macaulay Culkin shtick thrown in.



Except this is more a case of a self-generated ""Home Loan."" Young Preston is a barely put-upon youngest child, genially bullied by two older brothers and overlooked by easily distracted parents, but remembered by a grandmother who sends a signed blank check on his 11th birthday.



Dad fills in the amount, but that lesson in fiscal accountability is lost until an astounding series of coincidences typical of Disney juvenile fantasies. A just-sprung crook (Miguel Ferrer) visits his money-laundering banker (Michael Lerner) to exchange an old stash for fresh money. Leaving the bank, he accidentally runs over Preston's bike and, wishing to avoid a police inquiry, hurriedly scribbles a check to Preston -- a blank check, of course.



Bells go off: At home, Preston uses his home computer to fill in the amount: $1 million. And when he blithely goes to cash it, the banker mistakes him for the crook's messenger and hands him the million in cash. Using the voice box on his Macintosh (and assuming that name as the identity of a client who wants to be alone more than Greta Garbo ever did), Preston quickly makes a nearby castle his home, goes on a ""Pretty Woman""-style shopping trip (to the tune of ""Money""), orders what must be the entire contents of the Sharper Image and Modern Toys catalogues, and trucks in a year's supply of Coke and Chips Ahoy. He also installs a video wall, water slides, a go-cart track and a batting cage: It's the preadolescent version of the American Dream.

The bad guys, of course, soon catch on and try to regain their currency, suffering a series of predictable ""Home Alone""-style indignities, though these are more wet than violent (we're talking Disney). Later, one suggests ""it might be easier just to steal another million dollars!""

Along the way, Preston also teams up with a beautiful bank teller who turns out to be an undercover FBI agent on the trail of the free-spending but elusive Macintosh (the laundered money is also marked, it turns out). Karen Duffy -- former MTV personality Duff -- is actually quite sweet in a role that requires her to baby-sit for an 11-year old with a serious crush and an apparently unlimited allowance.

As for Bonsall, he's an endearing lovesick puppy, trying to act an age he has no clues about, ultimately discovering that money can't buy you love or happiness, though it apparently can help you while away your loneliness. On the other hand, he's Keatonishly cretinous as a wheeling, dealing mini-mogul in dark glasses (shades of Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business""). Ironically, it's this greed-oriented aspect of the film that's likely to elicit cheers of approval, since it's the aspect that director Rupert Wainright seems most comfortable with. In the end, family ties are re-strung, but the morals remain annoyingly at loose ends."
49,Star_Wars_1.docx,"The last ""Star Wars"" movie was somewhat divisive among fans. There were those that saw ""The Last Jedi"" as a step in a different direction, one that moved us further away from the midichlorians of the prequels while not feeling like a retelling of the original trilogy. Then there were those that decried it as blasphemy, that it was ""not a real 'Star Wars' movie,"" and saw this as the beginning of the end of Disney's reign. Rather than dwelling on why the latter group is wrong (oh so wrong), I'm left to ponder: Was ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" what they were hoping for? If so, I'm not sure I like the idea of a ""real 'Star Wars' movie"" anymore.

Let's start off with the elephant in the room in the same way that the movie decided to: Somehow, Palpatine returned. I'd tell you more about that, except that's all that the movie decides to tell (although the novelization apparently says that he is actually a clone). So yeah, the thing that drives the majority of ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is that Emperor Palpatine is back, so now our heroes have to deal with this guy. 

The last time that JJ Abrams directed a ""Star Wars"" we got ""The Force Awakens,"" a movie that is like a warm ""Star Wars"" nostalgia blanket. ""The Force Awakens"" is essentially ""A New Hope: The Reboot,"" but I was kind of okay with that. While its narrative structure is almost a carbon copy of the previous film, it attacks the material with gusto and charm. There is an almost giddy energy to ""The Force Awakens,"" and that can be felt. That energy is nowhere to be found with ""The Rise of Skywalker.""

Gone is the style, gone is the bravado, gone is the general coherence of story. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is a debacle of exposition and nonsensical plot. With that being said, its cavalcade of errors can easily slip under the radar, because Abrams insists upon never resting. As a result, you get distracted by the flashing lights and, honestly, Babu Frik. You leave the movie feeling that it wasn't great but, you know, you enjoyed it. 

But ""The Rise of Skywalker"" isn't content with your lackadaisical response, so the creative team has spent every moment since its release tacking on new plot points (because this movie needed more plot) or tiny explanations that leave you wondering: Why didn't you just put it in the movie? With no thought, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is serviceably entertaining, but once you start to think about it, it crumbles into a mess of convolutions. 

Regardless of the quality of the movies themselves, every physical release in this new trilogy has been fantastic and ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is no different. There are the usual featurettes (most of which can be found on YouTube) that cover topics from creature design to revisiting old friends of the franchise, and all of these are pleasant and offer"
50,Toy_Story_2.docx,"Pixar’s latest is a delightful movie about having no reason to exist.



...not having a reason to exist—and managing to make one’s existence joyful and meaningful anyway—is the central theme of the unexpectedly original (and expectedly delightful) Toy Story 4. As the movie begins, Woody, the cowboy doll, is dealing with the existential crisis of no longer being top toy. At Andy’s house, he was the most played-with of all and thereby the crew’s ringleader, whereas at Bonnie’s he’s all too often stripped of his sheriff’s badge and left to gather dust in the closet while his old friends are treated to tea parties, dress-up sessions, and hours of interactive fun. Given that Woody’s supreme motivation in life is to love and be loved by a child, this reduction in status leaves him both depressed and nostalgic for the good old Andy days. Anxious about Bonnie’s preschool orientation, Woody stows away in her backpack to offer support—and, if we’re being honest, to reassure himself of his own usefulness. It’s there, in the course of a getting-to-know-you craft project, that a new character is born who brings the question of existential anxiety even more to the fore.



Forky is a sorry specimen of a toy, but Bonnie’s love for him brings him to instantaneous if utterly befuddled life. For his first few days of life on Earth, his only instinctual goal is to fling himself back into the trash whence he came. Seeing how important this sentient utensil is to Bonnie, Woody makes it his job to save Forky, repeatedly and hilariously, from his headlong dives into the nearest garbage can.



In the last few days before preschool begins in earnest, Bonnie and her parents take a road trip to an old-fashioned amusement park with Woody, Forky, and the rest of the toys in tow. Just outside the fairgrounds is an antique store where Woody spots a familiar sight: a lamp base that once housed the porcelain doll Bo Peep, who used to belong to Andy’s little sister. Woody, who, always had a soft spot for Bo, sneaks into the shop to look for her, dragging the ever-confused Forky along with him.



In the dusty aisles of the antique store...the action divides along two fronts: Woody’s attempt to find Bo, escape the store and get back to Bonnie, and Bonnie and her parents’ efforts to track down her treasured missing spork before getting back on the road.



[Toy Story 4] is jampacked with innovative action sequences and skin-of-their-teeth escapes. It bounces along at such an antic pace that its 100 minutes feel like far fewer. But there’s a quiet contemplativeness at the movie’s heart, exemplified by a long scene in which Woody and Forky make their way along the shoulder of a highway, plastic hand in pipe-cleaner hand, discussing the meaning of life as a plaything. Theirs is a mentor-mentee relationship, but also, in its way, a parent-child one: “Carry me,” Forky demands intermittently, dragging his popsicle-stick feet on the gravel. By the end of that walk, Forky has begun to understand his purpose on Earth, and Woody is a little closer to reconsidering his own.

The choices Woody and the other characters make as the movie draws to a close don’t feel as necessary as the ending to Toy Story 3 did, but the emotions they evoke are similar: nostalgia for a lost past, hope for a yet-unknown future, affection for long-familiar companions."

Title: The Matrix 20 years on: how a sci-fi film tackled big philosophical questions

Authors: Richard Colledge 

Source/Date: The Conversation, March 27, 2019

Document 1



The film centres on a computer hacker, “Neo” (played by Keanu Reeves), who learns that his whole life has been lived within an elaborate, simulated reality. This computer-generated dream world was designed by an artificial intelligence of human creation, which industrially farms human bodies for energy while distracting them via a relatively pleasant parallel reality called the “matrix”.

This scenario recalls one of western philosophy’s most enduring thought experiments. In a famous passage from Plato’s Republic (ca 380 BCE), Plato has us imagine the human condition as being like a group of prisoners who have lived their lives underground and shackled, so that their experience of reality is limited to shadows projected onto their cave wall. 

A freed prisoner, Plato suggests, would be startled to discover the truth about reality, and blinded by the brilliance of the sun. Should he return below, his companions would have no means to understand what he has experienced and surely think him mad. Leaving the captivity of ignorance is difficult.

In The Matrix, Neo is freed by rebel leader Morpheus (ironically, the name of the Greek God of sleep) by being awoken to real life for the first time. But unlike Plato’s prisoner, who discovers the “higher” reality beyond his cave, the world that awaits Neo is both desolate and horrifying.

Ultimately, the Matrix trilogy proclaims that free individuals can change the future. But how should that freedom be exercised?

This dilemma is unfolded in the first film’s increasingly notorious red/blue pill scene, which raises the ethics of belief. Neo’s choice is to embrace either the “really real” (as exemplified by the red pill he is offered by Morpheus) or to return to his more normal “reality” (via the blue one).

This quandary was captured in a 1974 thought experiment by American philosopher, Robert Nozick. Given an “experience machine” capable of providing whatever experiences we desire, in a way indistinguishable from “real” ones, should we stubbornly prefer the truth of reality? Or can we feel free to reside within comfortable illusion? 

In The Matrix we see the rebels resolutely rejecting the comforts of the matrix, preferring grim reality. But we also see the rebel traitor Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) desperately seeking reinsertion into pleasant simulated reality. “Ignorance is bliss,” he affirms.

The film’s chief villain, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), darkly notes that unlike other mammals, (western) humanity insatiably consumes natural resources. The matrix, he suggests, is a “cure” for this human “contagion”.

We have heard much about the potential perils of AI, but perhaps there is something in Agent Smith’s accusation. In raising this tension, The Matrix still strikes a nerve – especially after 20 further years of insatiable consumption."
52,Walle_3.docx,"In WALL-E have spun a whimsical sci-fi fantasy about robots 800 years into the future that has all the heart, soul, spirit and romance of the very best silent movies 80 years ago. Well, you don't expect robots to talk, do you? While the soundtrack is full of clanking noises, explosions, music and even dance numbers, there is little dialogue as such to get this story told. Stanton and his animation team punch across their terrific (and ecologically sound!) story by inventing a visual and aural language with which these robotic creatures can express a rainbow of emotions.

The film is so clever and sophisticated that you worry, slightly, that it might be too clever to connect with mainstream audiences. It's so sweet and funny that the multitudes undoubtedly will surrender to its many charms.

A trashed and toxic Earth has been abandoned by mankind centuries ago, but somebody forgot to turn off the last robot. That would be WALL-E (an acronym that stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), a mobile trash compactor who goes about his job decade after decade. He has even developed a storage system so he can self-replace his parts. His only companion is a cockroach. Well, you knew that creature would survive anything.

Mankind, grown fat and lazy after centuries of floating like lotus eaters in a Club Med spaceship above Earth, sends a probe to search for signs of life on the abandoned planet. That would be EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). WALL-E develops a mighty crush on EVE, though her fearsome temper — she tends to blast anything that moves — makes him shy. But their romance, an innocence in the unlikeliest of places, blossoms. WALL-E even shows her his little green plant.

His little what? That's the very thing she's been looking for! That plant launches the couple on an epic journey to the Axiom spaceship, where with other ""rogue robots"" they overthrow a robotic controlled civilization and galvanize humans — more robotic than the actual robots — into something approaching life.

The visual design of WALL-E is arguably Pixar's best. Stanton, who wrote the script with Jim Reardon from a story he concocted with Peter Docter, creates two fantastically imaginative, breathtakingly lit worlds — a wretched, destroyed Earth city, not unlike Manhattan, and the spaceship where humans hover in floating couches, their bloated body fat encasing virtually useless bones, while an intricate series of robots perform all labor and a 3D Internet is the chief form of human communication.

The real stroke of brilliance, though, is the use of old movie footage, mixed in with the CG animation, to trigger WALL-E's romantic yearnings. After work, WALL-E endlessly watches a videotape from the 1969 movie Hello, Dolly! Its musical imagery and two songs make him understand what love and passion mean. He even learns how to hold hands, something he is finally able to try out with EVE.

Sound designer Ben Burtt creates expressive sounds given off by the robots, and in particular WALL-E, that you would swear are voices speaking words. If there is such a thing as an aural sleight of hand, this is it."
53,Back_Future_1.docx,"On July 3, 1985, Marty McFly skated into American theaters. Back to the Future, directed by Robert Zemeckis, then became a summer box-office win that spawned multiple sequels and propelled Michael J. Fox's career. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below. 

It's easy to see why Universal executives were so excited by Back to the Future. The movie isn't just fun. It's fun at the speed of light, a whiz-bang time-travel adventure likely to result in some decidedly high-octane box-office dollars. The most modest of Steven Spielberg's recent forays into production (the second this summer alone, after Goonies), Back to the Future is also one of the best, due in no small measure to the dandy direction of Robert Zemeckis, whose gift for off-center comic characterizations injects a welcome note of human comedy into the customary high-tech surroundings.

The script, by Zemeckis and longtime partner Bob Gale, concerns a Northern California teenager (Family Ties' Michael J. Fox, who replaced original lead Eric Stoltz midway through production) who takes refuge from his oddball domestic world — a sort of suburban Addams Family — in the company of a certifiably nutty professor (Christopher Lloyd at his scene-stealing best). When the good doctor soups up a DeLorean into a plutonium-powered time-mobile, the kid embarks on the ride of his life — back into 1955, where he unexpectedly encounters his own now-adolescent parents. 

It's every kid's fantasy come true, and Zemeckis exploits its possibilities with delicious abandon, deriving considerable humor from the situation's unseen generation gap. There's even shades of an Oedipal It's a Wonderful Life as the hero gamely fends off advances from his own future mother (delicately played by Lea Thompson) in a frantic attempt to ensure that his tamperings with the past have little bearing on his immediate future. 

The confusion makes for plenty of action (notably one dizzying sequence where Fox ""invents"" a skateboard and uses it to flee from a gang of '50s toughs), but this is at heart a gentler, less noisy endeavor than most Spielberg enterprises, brimming with fond nostalgia and people with the same sort of goofy supporting characters as past, more underrated Zemeckis efforts like Used Cars. Spielberg gets executive producer credit, but it's Zemeckis' movie all the way. 

There are occasional lapses in the general lightheartedness — the Libyan terrorists who set the main plot in motion are hardly a laughing matter these days. But there's simply too much fun on hand to be particularly spoiled. 

Adding to the pleasure is an attractive, energetic young cast, led by the appealing Fox, easily one of the more intelligent-looking young actors to cross a screen recently. As his soon-to-be mom, Thompson walks a hilarious line between diffidence and lust, and Crispin Glover is nerdism personified as her reluctant beau, with Thomas F. Wilson suitably menacing as a town bully who gets a gratifying comeuppance. But it's Christopher Lloyd who walks away with the movie in a gloriously uncontrolled, fright-wigged performance that redefines the mad scientist for modern movie audiences."
54,Walle_2.docx,"…Wall-E is a science- fiction epic set 700 years in the future. It consciously draws on a tradition of apocalyptic, dystopian sci-fi pictures.

Wall-E, pronounced Wally and an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, is that familiar Robinson Crusoe figure, the last occupant of Earth. A multinational corporation, Buy n Large, has been responsible, so we infer, for all the waste and pollution on our planet. As a result, Buy n Large's CEO, a bland hypocrite with the appropriate name of Shelby Forthright, has whisked away the human beings for a cruise on the luxury starship Axiom, leaving robots to clean up the planet.

Wall-E, now rusty, run-down and constantly repairing himself, has worked steadily over the centuries, compacting rubbish and piling it into giant pyramids on his arid urban wasteland. We soon discover he's developed a personality of his own as he sorts out things worth preserving from the endless waste of society. These little treasures include a Rubik's Cube, a light bulb, a hand-whisk and, above all, a VHS copy of the 1969 musical Hello, Dolly!. From watching this film, he learns to dance and to hold hands. Very soon, we feel lovingly sympathetic towards the diligent, lonely Wall-E (whose only company is a jolly cockroach).

Wall-E belongs to those creations of scientists and artists like Frankenstein's monster and the androids in Blade Runner, Geppetto's Pinocchio and Pygmalion's Galatea, who become vulnerably human. As in all Pixar movies, things and animals are all kinder, more likable than the humans they encounter. The passengers on the starship Axiom have become lazy, passive, obese and incapable of action or unassisted movement due to their pampered existence. Wall-E, indeed, is being set up to become the savior of humanity, which comes about when this lonely Adam is introduced to his new Eve (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a robot sent to Earth from Axiom to see if a return of so-called civilization is possible down here.

She's a gleaming, polished object resembling a production-line version of a Brancusi egg. White and pristine, she floats above the ground, unlike the rusty, sharp-edged Wall-E, who grinds around on caterpillar tracks. Wall-E is smitten and wants to hold hands like Michael Crawford and his girl in Hello, Dolly! He cares for Eve and they converse in their computer language. When she discovers a small green plant that Wall-E has kept, the vital sign of life on Earth, she's picked up by a rocket. He clings to this capsule and is taken back to Axiom.

The second part of the film, in which the maverick Wall-E stirs up a slave revolt and makes the complacent, exiled Earthlings aware of their humanity, is more conventional than the first part, though lively and exciting enough. The movie is constantly inventive in its inspired graphics and comic detail. Its warnings of a desperate, dying future world have a haunting realism far more powerful … but there is also a beautiful ending where we see the world rejuvenated."
55,Toy_Story_3.docx,"With Bo Peep, the sequel fashions a female hero who’s more than just a distaff rehash of the old male ones.

Even Pixar agnostics like me...must admit that the second and third installments of the series are exceptional portraits of existential anxieties about the end of innocence and play. Pixar is betting that a new character, the unwilling toy Forky—a deliberately ugly spork with mismatched googly eyes that feels like the studio parodying its own MO of endowing inanimate objects with emotions and baby-deer peepers—will be the film’s breakout star. But it’s an older character—Bo Peep, a ceramic shepherdess in a yearslong flirtation with Sheriff Woody—who’s the film’s greatest delight and most original creation. Voiced by Annie Potts and finally developed into her own person, Bo invigorates the Toy Story franchise by being the rare female character expanded in a sequel whose journey doesn’t feel secondary.

But the continual relegation of stories about girls and women to sequels, spinoffs, and reboots—films that are almost by definition derivative, ancillary, and inessential—can’t help but cement our cultural bias that male narratives are primary and female narratives supplementary. Moreover, such sequels and reboots imply that female characters are only worth paying attention to so long as they are in relation to boys and men, by either providing a high contrast to or being fundamentally interchangeable with male characters in traditionally male situations.

Bo began the franchise as a run-of-the-mill trophy for male cinematic heroism: a blond, blue-eyed, delicate, and conventionally beautiful female who existed to be rescued and to reward Woody for his heroic acts with chaste kisses. But in Toy Story 4, she gets a welcome personality transplant, not to mention a makeover to match. (Who knew a shepherd’s hook could be such a versatile weapon?) This fourth chapter, in contrast to the second and third, posits that toys can evade the tragedy of obsolescence, and that a domesticated lifestyle of emotional dependence on a child’s whims is essentially a gilded cage. And it’s Bo who expresses this idea most clearly. After some years as an unwanted product in an antique store, she escapes to become a “lost” toy free of human attachments—and is transformed into the person she was seemingly always meant to be. Once the Smurfette of Andy’s room—the only girl character in a village of men who was only there to do stereotypically feminine things—she founded her own crew of misfit toys, sought to give them a full life, and in the process became far braver and worldlier than Woody. In the end, he needs her far more than she needs him. The sounds of her ceramic feet running on concrete underscores her courage and independence, as does her shrugging nonchalance when her arm falls off. Her current existence is very possibly precarious, but it’s hers to lead.

So refreshing is her new lease on life that, when Woody is forced to choose once more between her and his old kid-centric life—which was, as the prologue reminds us, the only thing that mattered to him—it’s a bit of a shame Bo ends up with such a neurotic prig. Her role in Toy Story 4 is to show Woody that there’s happiness to be found in a post-Andy world, but you also get the sense throughout that she’d have been just as happy if they’d never reunited and she’d dedicated the rest of her days to rescuing other discarded toys from hopelessness."
56,Big_Lewbowski_2.docx,"After 20 years, the shaggy-dog stoner LA noir that may be the Coens’ comic masterpiece rolls back on to the big screen, as light and insouciant as the tumbleweed from the old west that drifts incongruously up to the city in the opening sequence. In fact, after two decades, the film looks weirdly less shaggy, less dishevelled to me: sleeker, sharper, more integrated and with more menace, more mystery. (I found myself thinking of Thomas Pynchon and of David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive). Sam Elliott’s basso profundo narrator, topping and tailing the action and appearing enigmatically in the middle, creates a fascinating residue of unease. But there are just as many laughs.



Our sub-Chandleresque hero is Jeffrey “the Dude” Lebowski, unforgettably played by Jeff Bridges: a younger or more lightweight actor would have made this character seem merely silly. He is a man whose plot function is so close to that of the classic private eye that he is mistaken for one by another private eye late on in the film.



The Dude is, in fact, a former 60s radical and political activist who casually claims to have written an early and uncompromised draft of the Port Huron Statement, but is now permanently at ease, wearing a dressing gown, sunglasses and athleisure-pyjamas combo with flip-flops indoors and out. He is passionate about just one thing – bowling. The Dude is in a team with a couple of other slackers: belligerent Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and easygoing Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi), and they are preparing to face off against some hated rivals, led by the arrogant but brilliant bowler and convicted paedophile Jesus Quintana (John Turturro).



One day, a couple of thugs mistakenly rough up the Dude because a wealthy LA plutocrat with the same name has a high-spending young wife who owes them some money. The Dude goes to see this other “Big” Lebowski (David Huddleston) in high dudgeon to demand some kind of reparation, meeting his uptight private secretary (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and then the alluring younger spouse Bunny (Tara Reid). It is a chaotic situation from which a financial opportunity arises: Bunny is kidnapped and Mr Lebowski hires the Dude as his bagman to deliver the ransom money. The arrangement descends into anarchy.



There is something inspired in the way that the Coens have access to a kind of fantasy-trance state that is always close by. Bowling has a lot to do with it, more than weed, even: not merely the lighter-than-air sense of triumph that accompanies a perfect strike, but the weird and hidden world beneath the bowling alley, where the balls go, where the skittles go, how they are miraculously reconfigured every time. An occult pattern under the everyday world.



There are wonderful fantasy sequences where the Dude flies through the air, like Christopher Reeve’s Superman, the twinkling lights of the city beneath him, and also some great Hollywood musical sequences featuring Mr Lebowski’s beautiful but prickly daughter Maude – a tremendous performance from Julianne Moore."
57,Interstellar_4.docx,"Interstellar Review



The title of Christopher Nolan’s behemoth space epic says it all – a grandiloquent declaration of scale that smacks simultaneously of ambition and hubris – like Titanic, both the ship and the film. The good news is that this flawed but frequently awe-inspiring movie about wormholes and black holes does not implode into a dark star of disappointment; if it’s spectacle you want, then Interstellar delivers, particularly when viewed in Nolan’s preferred 70mm Imax format.



Seamlessly amalgamating his own semi-formed stories about space travel with a script that his brother Jonathan (“Jonah”) had been developing for Steven Spielberg, Nolan’s long-gestating magnum opus is a futuristic fable firmly rooted in the age-old traditions of sci-fi. We open in a dust-bowl dystopian future where blighted food supplies are dwindling and inhabitable Earth is dying. Harking back to Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie’s 1933 novel When Worlds Collide (a Depression-era text brought to the screen by producer George Pal in the 1950s), Nasa builds a “space ark” – a giant ship that will take mankind to a new home in the stars, provided the “problem of gravity” can be solved by avuncular Professor Brand (Michael Caine).



Meanwhile, Right Stuff-style pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is prompted by ghostly forces to lead an exploratory mission through a wormhole beyond the rings of Saturn, abandoning his family in search of a future for all humanity. What follows is a dizzying mash-up of The Haunting, Slaughterhouse-Five, Silent Running, Event Horizon and the director’s cut of Aliens, with the inverted time shifts of Inception (an hour on a distant planet equals lost years back on Earth) thrown in for extra emotional heft.



While it’s temptingly easy to cite 2001 (anything invoking a dimensional “star gate” triggers rarely positive Kubrick comparisons), the movie that hangs over Interstellar like the dust cloud atmospherically engulfing its earthbound scenes is Contact, with which it shares much more than just leading man McConaughey. Adapted from a novel by Carl Sagan (with signature input from Interstellar’s theoretical physicist Kip Thorne), Robert Zemeckis’s 1997 epic similarly centred on a daughter crying out to a lost father whose soul seems to abide somewhere across the universe.



In both movies, it is these daughters who detect the first stirrings of an “alien” encounter: Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) identifying recurrent sequences in the white noise of interstellar radiation in Contact; Murph (very affectingly played in her younger years by Mackenzie Foy) spying morse code in poltergeist disturbances in Interstellar. From such discoveries are missions launched, voyaging across time and space at the apparent instruction of a superior intelligence offering cryptic hands across the universe.



Intergalactic portals are breached, timescales bifurcated, science and faith reconciled. Crucially, for all their astro-maths exposition, the constant in both stories is neither time, space, nor gravity, but love. More than once I was reminded of Contact’s Ellie striking the outer limits of the universe and breathlessly declaring: “They should have sent a poet.” In dispatching Nolan beyond the stars, that’s exactly what they’ve done.



While the end result may not represent the pinnacle of Nolan’s extraordinary career, it nevertheless reaffirms him as cinema’s leading blockbuster auteur, a director who can stamp his singular vision on to every frame of a gargantuan team effort in the manner of Spielberg, Cameron and Kubrick. “Whose subconscious are we in?” asked Ellen Page in Inception. The answer here, as always, is unmistakably Nolan’s."
58,Blank_Check_2.docx,"`CHECK' CASHES IN ON HOLLYWOOD GREED



It says something about ""Blank Check"" that its writers and their agent used a gimmick to pitch the script to studios: Instead of relaying it in a discreet manila envelope, they stuffed the tome in a backpack of the sort the movie's 11-year-old hero wears, along with some wads of play money.

It says something about Hollywood that someone actually bought the ploy and made it into one of the sleazier movies ever marketed to kids.

With its contrived plot, its MTV-inspired montages and its blatant shilling for products, it is film as hard sell, and it comes with a decidedly suspect warranty. Its mercantile instincts are so primary it looks like an infomercial.

Were it wittier, and morally informed, ""Blank Check"" might have been a hilarious parody of the '80s: A boy with strong feelings of entitlement (Brian Bonsall) is handed a blank check by a nasty ex-con who damages his bicycle. He has his computer fill in the blank for a million bucks and, through one of those mixups which could only happen in the movies, collects the cash.

He promptly goes on a colossal spending spree, buying a mansion down the block to escape his strict, money-grubbing father, installing every conceivable fantasy toy (The Sharper Image features prominently here) and courting a luscious bank teller who is actually an undercover FBI agent. All the while, the boy must evade the ex-con and his accomplices (including rapper Tone Loc) who are out to recover their loot, the reward of previous crimes.

But instead of parodying the excesses of the '80s, ""Blank Check"" works hard to re-create them at the junior level, piling on self-gratification at a rate that is almost pathological.

And while the ex-con is led away in handcuffs, there is no mention of the boy's ill-gotten gains or of the consequences of his chicanery. Instead, he goes home to the sort of family where his exploits have gained him new respect.

Clearly, the message here is that children may dispense with consciences and bear no responsibility for their actions.

The production values in ""Blank Check"" boast the sort of slick proficiency that makes its soullessness all the more insidious. But even proficiency cannot produce laughs. The film is mildly funny only in exchanges between the boy and his chauffeur, played by Rick Ducommun.

Such a movie for children (from Disney yet) is a scary sign that Hollywood's sensibilities are so out of whack there is no ethical bedrock left. Seeing a movie is a voluntary act. If it weren't, ""Blank Check"" would qualify as child abuse."
59,Blade_Runner_3.docx,"""I think some — a lot— of people enjoy it, and that's their prerogative,"" a grumpy Harrison Ford told the Boston Globe in 1991. ""I played a detective who did no detecting. There was nothing for me to do but stand around and give some focus to Ridley's sets."" Ah well, he didn't much enjoy being in Star Wars either, and some — a lot — of people enjoyed that, too. The truth is, few actors come off well in sci-fi movies if they feel that it's them versus the sets or them versus the director's imagination. As it is, Harrison Ford's apparent bemusement works perfectly within Ridley Scott's framework; his former blade runner Rick Deckard, though expert at ""retiring"" the almost-human androids known as replicants, spends most of the film bemused.

Blade Runner is possibly the most talked-about sci-fi movie ever made. It achieved this honour by being a failure on its original release, thus attaining the valuable sheen of a true cult (something that could never be said about Star Wars, despite the rapacity of its followers). When re-released theatrically in the form of a Director's Cut in 1992, it was reappraised by formerly sniffy critics, and more people paid to see it. The irony of this belated legitimisation is that the Director's Cut is more cryptic and ambiguous than the original, and — crucially to the sort of fan who roams the Internet — supported the popular theory that Deckard himself is a replicant.

There are actually only minor differences between the original and the Director's Cut (indeed, the tag is misleading, as it's actually a compromise between director and studio). Scott removed the explanatory voice-over and happy ending, both of which had been added after disastrous sneak previews. He also introduced a 12-second dream sequence involving a unicorn, which helps explain the significance of an origami unicorn that appears in the final sequence. Oddly, some of the extra frames of violence in the video version are now excised. While obsessive aficionados hotly debate the merits of each version (and whether Deckard is a replicant or not), the casual fan will glean enough pleasure just watching the film — any bloody version — and admiring its astonishing production values.

In Blade Runner, the sleek and the ugly, the ancient and the modern, co-exist, just as they do in any big city today (the Ancient Egyptian grandeur of the Tyrell Corporation versus the dilapidated, leaky hulk of J.E Sebastian's building). Perhaps this is why Blade Runner's future is so compelling, and why it's still duplicated ad nauseum in rock videos and bank adverts.

But Blade Runner is more than a collection of stunning pictures. It oozes the type of allegory that will keep stoners up all night for years to come. Try this one for size: Batty (Hauer) is Jesus — after all, he sticks a nail through his hand and dies, releasing a dove as he does so — and Tyrell (Joe Turkel), referred to by Batty as his ""maker"", is God. This theory makes the replicants us. Well, humans are programmed, like replicants, to die from birth, a paradox encapsulated in the last line of the film: ""It's too bad she won't live! But then again, who does?"" Stick that in your bong and smoke it."
